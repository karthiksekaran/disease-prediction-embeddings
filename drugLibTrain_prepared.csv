The Ponstel doesn't take the pain away completely, but takes the edge off so much that normal activities were possible. Definitely a miracle medication!!",Heavier bleeding and clotting than normal.,"I took 2 pills at the onset of my menstrual cramps and then every 8-12 hours took 1 pill as needed for about 3-4 days until cramps were over. If cramps are bad, make sure to take every 8 hours on the dot because the medication stops working suddenly and unfortunately takes about an hour to an hour and a half to kick back in.. if cramps are only moderate, taking every 12 hours is okay."
3947,prilosec,3,Marginally Effective,Mild Side Effects,acid reflux,"The acid reflux went away for a few months after just a few days of being on the drug. The heartburn started again as soon as I stopped taking it. So I began treatment again. 6 months passed and I stopped taking it. The heartburn came back, and seemed worse even. The doctor said I should try another 6 month treatment. I did, and the same exact thing happened. This went on for about three years. I asked why this wasn't curing my reflux. The doctor quite frankly told me that it wasn't a cure, but a ""treatment for the symptoms"". I was told that I would probably be on it for the rest of my life.","Constipation, dry mouth and some mild dizziness that would go away after medication was stopped for a few days.","I was given Prilosec prescription at a dose of 45mg per day. Medication was taken once, every morning before eating. Each treatment duration was for 6 months."

When it came to school work though I found that I needed the 30mg to increase my level of focus (and have been on it for a month since).  I had not experienced decreased appetite until about a month into taking the 20mg.  I find that the greatest benefit of Vyvanse for me is that it tends to stabalize my mood on a daily basis and lessens any bouts of anxiety and depression that i used to face before I was perscribed.
2715,elavil,10,Considerably Effective,No Side Effects,depression,"Although this drug was originally prescribed for depression, it helped with sleeplessness. Therefore, I have continued to take it for that alone. While I still on occasion have problems falling asleep, I find I can combine it with Melatonin or Valerian. In 12 years, I haven't had to increase the elavil dosage.",None.,"One a day, taken about an hour before bedtime."
1591,xanax,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,panic disorder,"This simply just works fast and without any of the nasty side effects of SSRI medicines. I won't go into a long story of my panic attacks which I sought help for many years after the fact. This just works and it does what it's supposed to without any annoying side effects. When taken daily, it has stopped my panic attacks from starting and thinking patterns that lead to them. I find it can also be used as needed along with the daily treatment.","I really don't have any side effects other than the mild but very tolerable issue of taking it 4-5 times a day which isn't an effect but just the way you need to take this. At first, within the first 1 day then couple of weeks after starting, this medicine is broken down by your body fast and you need to adjust your dose. Once I got past the ups and downs of the first week or two of getting this increased from .25 mg - 3 times per day to what I'm on now things are so stable and just smooth.","I first started taking this at 3 times per day with .25 mg pills. I was advised not to take as needed with my panic attacks as that would reinforce the idea of taking a pill when it's needed and not help me work around my anxiety. This is totally true. At first I wished to only take them as needed but with my doctor's advice, he was right. This really does work when you take it daily at 3-5 times per day. This way your body adjusts to what's going on with the panic and makes no association with taking a pill to prevent or stop it, they just don't start in the first place. Yes, I still do have minor attacks and worry episodes here and there but nothing at all like the many years before this. I wish that this extremely helpful medicine would not have such a bad name in media, news and pharmacies. This works wonders and there is no want or need to take more or become and addict. People and doctor's need to  understand more on how to treat someone with something that just WORKS, rather than trying to give them SSRI's which are what the drugs companies push, all for money reasons. And, the doctor's out there who decide that SSRI's are the only option, they need to go back to medical school!"

Effective at controlling ADD symptoms previously controlled by Adderall however this drug seems more natural and transparent. Less tension and anxiety. Less ""druggy"" unnatural feelings and thoughts.",Dexerine IR tablets need to be taken more often than adderall and also wear off more abruptly. Generic tablets are not high quality and somewhat expensive due to the need for a large quantity of tablets.,Switched from Adderall to Dexedrine to compare the effects. Dexedrine is simply dextroamphetamine while Adderall is a mixture of Amphetamine salts. This might explain the increased effectiveness of the Dexedrine contrary to popular belief. I found it important to take several relatively low doses frequently to achieve a balanced effect.

My eye exams have been normal with eye preassure normal.,For the first 6-8 weeks I used one drop every night applied to upper lash base with a small disposable brush.

Very good at alleviating any anxiety and jittery feelings.  'Levels out' my mood but doesn't cause euphoria; I have no desire to take more than I need.  However I am very dependent on it; if I stop taking it for a couple of days I have bad nervousness and jitteryness, tachycardia, sweating, and other anxiety symptoms.

1246,sotret,10,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,acne,"I took isotretinoin for persistent adult acne.  My skin was not by any means awful, but I did have evident pimples on my forehead and chin, and awful, awful blackheads on my nose that despite daily steaming and extraction, were terrible.  The drug totally cleared up my face, and my blackhead literally dried up in front of my eyes.  My once horribly oily skin changed to almost normal.","First, let me say that I didn't experience the awful side effects that some do with isotretinoin use.  I did turn very, very red around the perioral area and especially at the nasolabial folds.  My face felt as if I needed to peel it off and scratch deep down in the dermis.  In fact, that was my main complaint--the itchiness . . . and of course the dryness.  But the dryness was not nearly as bad as I expected.  For example, my lips never cracked.  However, I'm several years out from treatment , and I still have dry skin problems.  It's weird because my skin was always so oily and now it's dry.  But that could be attributed to normal aging.  Regardless, I've become a real connosiour of facial moisturizers.  My skin is also a little more sensitive post isotretinoin.  Tazorac one percent, which I used to slather on nightly like lotion, now sets me on fire if I dare to use the half percent version more than twice a week.  I know the literature claims there's no anti-aging efficacy if it isn't used daily, but I'm hoping for the best.","I have to confess that I'm confused by this section.

I don't know if this has been the case with other patients, and I'm curious to know if anyone else has had that experience.
I'm also presenting with a little 'feathery tickle', resulting in an annoying dry cough; perhaps this side effect will lessen as my body adapts to the medication.","My doctor started me on a minimal dose (25 mg) of Lamotrigine, and this will be prior to starting Interferon/Ribavarin treatment for the Hep-C I've got.  (An antidepressant may be added in the near future as well.) Lamotrigine was prescribed to put me in a calmer state of mind, specifically because of the high anxiety effect I receive from antidepressants, which resulted in 2 visits to an emergency room - as well as a one month hospital stay due to extreme anxiety and paranoia.

In the morning after I would take a dose the effects were noticeble and even pronounced, however after about lunchtime it totally wore off and I would have to take another dose, but if the second pill is taken later in the day it sometimes would interfere with sleep so one must be carful to take the pill at the right time."

I am convinced it has kept me from sliding into a full depression. It works on 3 levels for me: 1. My body gets rest so I can 'fight' for another day. 2. My brain heals. 3. I can endure a difficult day knowing I can take the pill and go to sleep. I consider it a miracle cure for preventing a full blown depression.

I take the entire dose at one time, daily, and have been advised that the feeling of being revved up would disspiate if I did take it in two or more doses during the day.  I try to minimize the effect by taking the medication first thing in the morning.","I suffer chronic depression and the Wellbutrin is the first antidepressant that did not sedate me, and the only that did not dampen sexual feelings.  I have taken tricyclics (sp?) which were extremely sedating as well as limiting as far as OTC medications and dietary restrictions.  I have also tried SSRIs (prozac, zoloft, etc.)and while they temporarily relieved my depression, 1) the effect did not last more than 6 months, and 2) they completely destroyed my libido."
2360,propecia,8,Moderately Effective,Mild Side Effects,male pattern baldness,"Ostensibly this will halt or even reverse the effects of male-pattern baldness. So far, one month in, there is not a great deal to report. I expected my hair loss to temporarily increase, as I had read in the literature that as dormant hair follicles reactivate, they push dead hairs out in order to form new ones. In other word, hair in a dead follicle will linger for a few months, and reactivation of the follicle will push out the old hair to make room for the new. So far, this has not occurred. The product must be taken for up to two years for any noticeable hair growth to take place, so I really haven't been on it long enough to judge its re-growth potential. In terms of halting the process, however, I must say there are fewer hairs in my brush each morning, so it's possible the drug is having an effect already. I will post a fuller report in another forty-seven months, I suppose.","I was surprised to experience brief blinding headaches in the upper left rear quadrant of my head, like a mini seconds-long burst of pressure that felt like a blunt object suddenly trying to explode out of my skull. This pressure would subside and I would go about my day. I'm told headaches are not one of the usual side-effects, so it may be an unrelated fluke. However, I've never had such an experience before, and it only manifested within about forty-eight hours of my first taking the drug and for seventy-two hours thereafter. The sudden and sporadic bursts of acute pain subsided, however, but I would caution anyone taking this drug for the first time to be on the lookout, especially if driving or in a public place with bright lights and a lot of noise around.","Overall, whether I am having some sort of placebo-effect reaction or not, my subjective impression is that hair loss has slowed or stopped and that the hair remaining appears fuller. I presented my symptoms to the doctor and she issued a prescription that same day, which I filled that afternoon at a local pharmacy and began taking immediately. The formulation I was prescribed was 1 milligram, although I believe the usual prescription is for 2 milligrams and can go as high as 5 milligrams. My case was mild to begin with, so it may be difficult to judge results. However, other than the mild side-effects I described above, which subsided within three days, I must say overall that my experience has been a positive one."

By the second day, there had been no further development of redness or additional blistering as there would have been in previous times before taking this medication.
On the third day, the redness and initial sign of blister formation had diminshed even further.
By the fifth day after taking this medication, there were no longer any signs or symptoms of what had started out to be, as I had experienced in my previous cold sore outbreaks, a 10 to 12 day spell of uncomfortable and unsightly fever blisters.

Not good to take this medication unsupervised.,Have a bulging disc.  I was given Carisoprodol to relieve the pain.  I took the medication for 2 weeks.

3382,lipitor,5,Moderately Effective,Moderate Side Effects,high cholesterol,"My overall cholesterol reduced to just over 4, but not LDL which still remained high within that total. This in my opinion is due to my thyroid condition.",After several months with no side effects I suddenly had continuous bad muscular neck pain and stiffness (particularly at night) which got better when I stopped the statin.,My cardiologist orginally prescribed atorvastatin and Omacor (at my asking about Omega 3 efficacy) due to my having a completed blocked artery in my heart (discovered on an ebt scan by my thyroid doc). I have since tried other statins but have not stayed on any of them very long due to lack of results in bringing down my LDL and side effects such as stomach pain.

Also, unlike some of the anti-inflammatory drugs I had taken in the past, I was not drowsy or sluggish during the day and I felt as if I could function normally.","In the beginning I had very slight dizziness that would quickly subside and immediately noticed a significant decrease in appetite. After about 2 months it did not seem to work as well for the pain as it hd been. I also had what felt like strong muscle spasms that made my entire body twitch, but only for a second and only once in a while.  Therefore, I decided that I would discontinue taking the medication.

I had cold chills,severe body aches, diarrhea, nausea, headache, heart palpitations, anxiety, sweating, dizziness, vomiting and depressed feelings. I got a refill prescription to gradually come off of it after that and it occurred once again.  I have never had substance abuse issues but after doing some research learned that it is opiate-based and highly addictive. I have never felt that kind of pain and sickness in my life and pray I never do again. I have heard similar experiences from others as well. I would not recommend this drug and do not believe that it is not addictive.  From now on, I will do my homework before I take anything else. I now use OTC pain relievers and I encourage everyone who reads this to do the same before beginning treatment with tramadol or any pain reliever."
4126,chantix,5,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,stop smoking aid,"Chantix did effectively reduce the urge to have a cigarette.  Taken twice per day was most effective, but side effects precluded that dosage for this patient(see below). Chantix was taken in the morning, and patient rarely, if ever, even thought of wanting or 'needing' a cigarette during the day.  In the evening, however, (when the second pill was due to be taken, but wasn't), and especially if patient had an alcoholic beverage, the urge to smoke returned  with a vengence, though a few puffs were all it took to kill the urge.  When patient stopped taking Chantix (after a year of use), the urge for nicotine returned.","The side effects for patient were 1) an upset stomach directly after taking pill, and 2) VERY disturbing and vivid dreams.  Patient found that, regarding the stomach upset, it was less important to have food in your stomach before taking the pill (stomach still got upset), than to actually take the pill in the midst of eating, (i.e. eat some food, take the pill, then eat some more).  This method of taking the pill virtually eliminated the stomach upset problem.  As to the vivid dreams, that is why the patient only took one pill in the morning and did not take the pill in the evening.  Although patient still occasionally had vivid dreams, the incidence was far less often than when taking the pill twice per day.","Chantix was prescribed per the guidelines noted by the manufacturer.  As noted above, the dosage was altered by the patient to alleviate negative side effects.  Although a stop-smoking plan was packaged with the initial prescription, the patient stopped participating in the follow up due to the lack of urges for cigarettes.  This, however, may be why the patient was on the prescription for a year versus a few months."

Its purpose was pain relief, and I did not experience any alleviation of my pain.",I did not experience any side effects from taking this medication.,"I was prescribed this medication after being seen by a doctor for a severely infected cat bite wound on the top of my left foot (which the doctor was concerned might become a systemic infection).  The foot and my entire left leg were very painful (especially upon movement), so the doctor had me take Ultram ER to help relieve the pain.  I was told to take 1 tablet daily as needed.

I developed Petechiae which is the bleeding of small capillaries in the skin or mucous membrane. It appears as round pinpoint sized dots that vary in colour from red to blue or purple. These dots most commonly appear on the legs but can appear all over the body. Also an onset on Acne developed on my back at about the same time which was quite severe, and I have never had Acne related problems, even in my youth.","Currently my physician has taken me off of my BP meds to allow the Petechiae to fade, and to ensure that the reaction was indeed related to the Lotrel. It has been 4 days and slowly the rash and redness is mellowing."

The first week was fine. The beginning of the second week I began to have sore muscles all over. By the end of the second week this was so bad I could hardly get out of bed in the morning. So I quit the Lipitor (did not consult the doctor on this); in the AARP magazine (or else newsletter, not sure which) there was a question for the medical doctor about possible natural replacements for the statin medications and he recommended Red Yeast Rice. I found a product with that and a few other cholesterol-lowering supplements (primarily CoQ-10) ad have been taking that with no side effects.

I have tried to up the dose in the am with no difference.",I am not sure if this is from the provigil or not but I have started having major breathing issues. I have had this a long time ago but started taking celexa for it and it worked. Now I am taking klonopin for it sometimes it works sometimes not. I wonder if it is being caused from the provigil.,I just take one 200mg every morning when I get up. If I do not take it I thought is why I would be so sleepy during the day.

Also another downside of this medication is that if i take it when the cramping has started long and severe, it is less effective and it takes a lot longer for the medication to be effective, no matter how much i take.","Overall I'm very satisfied with the medication in it's efficacy and side effects profile. I only experience occasional side effects and in general the medication is very effective in treating and preventing menstrual cramping.

When I stopped taking the drug, my knees improved to the point where I am freely ambulatory, but they are still stiff with some pain.  I have had to consult an orthopedist, who tells me he has seen MANY such cases.  X-rays show I have the knees ""of a person 20 years younger,"" but the muscles have been grossly affected.","In place of the Caduet, which I stopped against the objections of my internist, I am using natural substances such as policosanol, CoQ10, and pycnogenol.

3486,diazepam,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,stress,"The drug calmed me down and stopped me from crying constantly.I only took it when absolutely necessary which was a huge benefit, unlike the anti anxiety drugs given out now which you have to take every day for long periods.Valium works instantly and I never had any problems at all with it. I do not understand why it is not given out instead of all these other antidepressants which are readily available and cause huge problems and come with awful side effects.",None to speak of except for slight tiredness.,"To be taken 3 times a day, but I only took as & when necessary."
109,celebrex,8,Considerably Effective,No Side Effects,arthritis,I started out with 100 mg twice a day and after about 3 years I've had to increase dosage to 200 mg in the morning and 100 mg at bedtime. It seems to keep my arthritis fairly under control but I have never been able to just take it once a day but I've also had arthritus for 35+ years. Unfortunatelt cold fronts and weather changes still bother my joints. This mediicine keeps me active and pretty much able to do most of what I want to do.,I haven't really had any noticeable side effects.,See above. I am concerned thaqt the dosage might have to be upped after a few more years.
691,accutane,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,severe acne,My skin cleared up and my pores shrank significantly. My skin looked flawless. My pores have remained smaller long-term (5+ years post treatment).,"My skin got very dry, including my lips. I had to use a significantly heaver moisturizer and lip ointment to keep my skin/lips from cracking.","I had monthly lab work and doctor's visits to make sure I was having no ill effects, which I did not. I suffered no psychological symptoms or depression, in fact I felt less depressed because my skin looked so much better.

I would encourage patients and doctors not to be so frightened of this drug. It's a serious drug and bears monitoring, but lots of drugs are. I tried Retin-A and that made my skin look and feel horrible, as did other topical treatments. The benefits to your skin and your self-esteem make Accutane worth consideration if other treatments have not been effective."
1321,prevacid,7,Considerably Effective,Severe Side Effects,acid reflux,I suffered from acid reflux symptoms which included mild stomach upset and a full feeling after eating. Prevacid eliminated these symtoms very effectively to the point that I did not need repeated doses of over the counter anti-gas medication and antacids.,"Taken daily, Prevacid unfortunately caused severe side effects which included dizziness and a woozy feeling like I was over medicated. The side effects were so severe that I often was unable to work and needed to lie down and occasionally took a nap.","Prior to taking Prevacid, my symptoms required daily doses of anti-gas medications and occasional antacids. Although Prevacid was very effective, I discontinued use of it and switched to over the conter Zantac because of the side effects. As a note, I am very sensitive to medications and often experience side effects from different medications and thus refrain from any unless experiencing severe symptoms."
1004,actiq,1,Highly Effective,Severe Side Effects,chronic pain,"Without question, Actiq is an extremely effective drug if you are in chronic severe pain and have no responsibilities.  Actiq relaxes the body and the brain becomes numb and able to handle ongoing pain effectively.  It is fast acting in the subcutaneous, ""lollipop"" form and within minutes you are comfortable.
The flavor is also quite pleasant.","Actiq, when taken as directed, induces a feeling of numbness. and slurred speech is common. Thinking becomes confused and it is not unusual to fall asleep in mid-sentence. Actiq slows breathing and causes extreme tiredness.  Actiq are highly addictive and it is literally impossible to stop taking them without a medical detoxification.
Actiq delivered in subcutaneous form causes the teeth to rot after extended use of more than 6 months.","Actiq should only be taken by individuals who are in severe, chronic pain where
tolerance to the drug will not become problematic.  It needs to be closely monitored and locked away out of reach of children or any adult who may have problems with addiction.
My  chronic  pain condition was followed by a Pain Center at a reputable hospital.  The use of opioids were used only after all other treatments for
my condition had failed.
Unfortunately, once Actiq was introduced to me, my medical problems worsened, although my pain was under control.  I was unable to function responsibly, began dealing with symptoms of withdrawal whenever I didn't take it, which at times became worse than my actual pain and discomfort.  I became more of a patient to my family and on a side note, at age 40 lost 4 molars due to the ingredients present in the ""lollipops"" I was taking.
I had no choice but to be hospitalized for an inpatient medical detox in order to safely get this horrible drug out of my body.  Fortunately my husband and I were fortunate enought to have the money to go through this detox program.
I have no memory of 2 years of my life, thanks to an ignorant, negligent doctor and the drug, Actiq.  
Believe it or not, my painful conditions are now completely under control now, and I am able to care for my husband and children, and work!  After my experience with Actiq I no longer believe in the use of pharmaceutical products as a whole, and owe my good health to diet, exercise and several natural supplements.  I have never felt better in my life!"

Seriously, I could not even tell I had taken a drug, there were no impacts whatsover, either positive or negative.","Took 2 tablets (15 mg) total, once daily in the morning.  Also took Zanaflex, but only at night.  The Zanaflex helped - for about 3 hours.  When I was just on the meloxicam, I was in terrible pain.  The injury being treated was mid-back pain, caused by straining/overusing my back muscles in a ski competition.  I have a 30 day prescription for meloxicam, but I'm calling the doctor tomorrow to ask for something different; this drug is totally pointless for me."

Before going on the pill, I would have awfully irregular periods, and very bad cramps the first day of my cycle. Since going on it, my periods have become light, and regular. My breast have gotten larger, and my skin has cleared up. This pill is great!

Zestoretic lowered my blood pressure to acceptable levels of 100/70 from 130/90.  The difference between this medicine and prior ones seems to be the diuretic.  After experiencing the positive benefits of the diuretic I began watching my sodium intake.  I avoid any food that contains 900 or over mgs of sodium per serving.  This pretty much eliminates most canned soups, dry packaged side dishes and frozen foods.  After 16 months of watching my sodium intake I have become much more sensitive to sodium and no longer use table salt",,I take two tablets once a day at breakfast.

I have more energy, and feel like myself again.","I never had any side effects.  The only drawback is that you have to take the medication on an empty stomach or wait three hours after you eat.  However, they prefer you take it in the morning.  So what I do is keep my medicaton next to my bed and take it the very first time I wake up in the morning whether it's 4, 5, or 6 am.","I returned from vacation in August by November I had gained 14 pounds.  I did not know why.  I was eating the same amount of food.  I went to see the doctor and after a complete check up and blood tests they found I had a low under active thyroid.  As I think back, I did feel more tired, I did not want to join my kids and spouse to do anything instead I would go to bed early.  That is not like me.  I am the type of person who would get up and go anytime.  I thought I was just tired.  Now, I reflect and remember that I stopped doing things with my family, became less active and all along I thought it was because I was tired when in actuality my thyroid was off."

A combination of other drugs was tried, and they had a limited ability to control the nausea. I had lost a lot of weight, and was at the point where the weight loss had left me pale and weak. When Zofran was added to the list of drugs I was given, I had immediate relief and was able to stop taking several of the other drugs.  I now take Zofran in the morning and evening and have stopped an unwanted weight loss and can enjoy eating again.   I recently had a biopsy where I had to have nothing in my stomach for twelve hours.  The prescribed pain killers after the procedure immediately brought back the vomiting, and my friend reminded the nurse that I usually used Zofran for that.  Within ten minutes after giving me a dose the nausea was gone and I was able to get much needed rest."

I gained weight but I didn't care because I was feeling REALLY good. As the years went by, I had to keep increasing and was up to 100mg. I had VERY dry mouth, I got to where I couldn't talk because my throat was so dry. I had to have a bottle of water next to me ALL the time, and I chewed gum constantly. I had to take laxatives every 3 days. I was so sick of it, I went to my doctor to see what was wrong with me. She thought it might be the amitriptyline, so she told me to wean off of it and she gave me 30mg of Cymbalta to start. I went down to 50mg and already started to feel my mouth was not so dry. Not sure how the Cymbalta is going to work since I've only taken it 4 days now, but I'm hoping it works.","I started with 10mg.  I noticed a difference after just one week. It worked really GREAT.

I also had some scar dents that have cleared up and/or mostly gone!","dryness, redness, irritation and peeling - it took a gradual working up to the 1% dosage without having serious redness/itching-pain/dryness/sensitivity.  I had already been on retin-A so my skin was already acclimated somewhat and yet I still had side effects.  I discovered that it's most important to wait at least 40-60 min. after washing your face before applying and apply only the very least amt necessary to have the thinnest of layers (more than that and you just get peeling).  And imperative NOT to use soap - change to a cleanser - cetaphil or other.  also,  an hour or two after applying, add a strong moisturizer.  With time, i needed a stronger daytime moisturizer too.  Redness/itching/burning/ decreased significantly within 2-3 months but skin remains highly sensitive and prone to dryness.  Sunscreen is a must and it was hard to find one that did not make my skin sting though most of the time, that stinging didn't last long (5-10 mins).  Overall though, with patience and time and not pushing and rushing things..it was well worth it

It was easier to start and finish projects because energy previously wasted on negative thoughts and actions was now available for constructive purposes.,"A total loss of any sexual sensation.  Prior to treatment interest in sex was low but paradoxically, when a feeling of psychological well-being produced a renewed interest in sex, the drug also removed the physical ability to engage in it.  Orgasm was impossible and physical arousal was too weak to be effective. 
The worst part was withdrawal following treatment.  It took at least 6 months of extremely gradual tapering off to withdraw, and I was on a low dose.  Any attempt to withdraw faster would produce chaotic mood swings from hysterical laughter to violent, yelling rages.  Every emotion, however mild, was magnified exponentially.  Sexual sensation also went off the scale with such hypersensitivity that ejaculations happened spontaneously without any physical stimulation - a sneeze or a yawning stretch would morph into an immediate ejaculating orgasm without any erection.  Throughout the withdrawal period a sensation of electric brain shocks extending to the arms and trunk would accompany any quick eye movement.","Just the one pill each morning.  This medication is such a double-edged sword that I could not recommend it.  The long term dangers of sustained treatment are too great, as evidenced by the severe withdrawal effects.

I didn't have awful acne, but it was persistent.","When I first began using the product I suffered serious side effects, especially to my neck.  My face became very, very dry and red, and it hurt.  After several weeks of toughing it out, I ended up skipping a nightly dose, and I think that helped.  It allowed my skin to recover a bit so that when I got back on the reginme the following night, I didn't suffer quite as badly.  From that time on, my neck just itched . . . and itched . . . and itched.  After about two weeks, though, my skin acclimated fully.","I was instructed by my dermatologist to wash my face nightly with a benign cleanser, wait twenty to thirty minutes, and then apply a very light film of product to my face and neck.

The retail theft occured while on just 5 mg of abilify. It effected my judgement/reasoning skills because I did not tell my doctor & allowed him to continue to increase dosage up to 15mg when I became expremely restless. Could not set down, paced for hours & called my doctor about this. Also during the 2 months I was taking this drug I charged a little over 15,000 on my credit cards that had no balance on them previously. If one did it was under $300. I still am currently unemployed & am having difficulty finding employement as a RN, due to my criminal record within the last year.

29,alprazolam,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,"panic disorder, agoraphobia","Helped me be able to leave the house for the first time in months, quickly reduced my anxiety and I didn't have any attacks.",Barely any despite some slight confusion.,"This medication (and other benzodiazepines) has gotten a bad reputation because some irresponsible people have ruined it for those that actually need it. If people would take this drug as prescribed, there would not be as many problems and it wouldn't carry the stigma it does now.

I started having panic attacks when I turned 21, and the condition soon worsened into full-blown panic disorder. A year later, I couldn't hold down a job and was agoraphobic. I tried counseling and medications like Zoloft and Lexapro. The side effects from those made me feel worse than I did just not taking them.

Finally my doctor decided to put me on Alprazolam as-needed. 

It has been a life-saver for me. I would take the lowest dose (0.25 mg), and be able to leave my house for the first time in months. I visited friends, went to restaurants, and did everything I used to do before my disorder. I finally felt like I had my life back. I would take one whenever I anticipated a situation where I could have an attack, or when I felt one coming on already. Sometimes I didn't even need all of the 0.25 mg and could break it in half. 

Too many people abuse this medication by upping their dosage without a doctor's consent or using it when they don't need to, and now you are almost treated like a criminal at some pharmacies and doctor's offices when they learn you are taking it because they think you are a druggie.

I *much* prefer this medication over any of the SSRIs, which have horrible side effects. I felt like a zombie on those medications, had no sex drive at all, and didn't have any energy whatsoever. The doctors tell you those side effects will go away with use, but for days to even weeks you feel 10 times worse than you did before. It's just not worth it.

0.25 mg of Alprazolam as-needed for anxiety has helped me get my life back on track and really helped save me from spending days and nights locked away in my house. I highly recommend this medication for responsible people who just need something in a crutch and don't want to go on long-term SSRIs that leave you feeling drained and lifeless.

Yes, counseling and therapy are a better alternative to medication, but the problem is always finding a *good* counselor, and sometimes even then, they just don't work. I have seen 3 counselors and all of them have failed to help me with anything, all I did was waste a $20 copay each visit to have them tell me things that sounded like they came from an inspirational booklet. 

Taken *as* prescribed or as-needed, this drug is wonderful."

(GETTING TENSE DIDN'T HELP EITHER ;-) I had trouble laying quietly, let alone sleeping. My teeth chattered and my legs twitched like crazy and there was a very painful weak spot in my lower back. I still have the painful weak spot and pretty severe migraines, but this drug was a quality of life saver. When I took it at the same time as Topomax it was ESPECIALLY effective.

Like twice a month!!,ocassional diarrhea and headache.,"I began getting cold sores about 5 years ago, when I was 35.  I would get them 3-4 times per year, especially when the weather changed.  My doctor prescribed me a 1mg tablet to take 2 of them in the morning and 2 at night at the onset of a cold sore.  It helped but the sore still ran its ugly course, even if I caught it right at the tingling point before it came out.  When I was 38, I went on birth control.  After about a year of being on Yaz, I began getting cold sores EVERY MONTH!  I told my doctor but she didn't think it was from the birth control - even though I read that BC suppresses your immune system, and anything that does that can allow for more instances of cold sores.  I went off the Yaz for 2 months, and STILL got cold sores during those two months.  So maybe she was right.  She then prescribed Valtrez 500mg once per day and I've been taking that since 9/09.  Still, like clockwork I get a cold sore every single month.  Either right before during or after my period.  So I think it's hormonal.  something is triggering them every month.  I've changed my diet completely, I take 4,000mg of Lsyine each day, I've tried the Red Marine Algae also.  No difference.  I'm a high stress personality anyway which doesn't help.  My doctor prescribed a mild sedative just to take the edge off and it does work great.  But still, the cold sores come like clockwork.  I just don't get it.  I'm starting a new job soon where I'll actually have to go to an office each day.  for the last 10 years I've been a road warrior, so I've been able to get around having to see people by making my own hours, especially if a cold sore errupts.  Now I don't know what I'll do.  It scares me and I'm stressed over that as well which doesn't help.  I feel plagued!  I don't know what else to try.  Maybe Acyclovir?"

My sciatica was not a condition that flared up continually; rather, it came approximately 4-6 times per month.","Excessive sleepiness, lack of concentration, feelings similar to those that one would experience taking oxycodone.  I felt ""high"" for many hours after taking this drug.","The plan was a permanent solution to my occasional flare-ups of sciatica.  My physician basically stated that there was no cure for my pain; therefore, I needed to be placed on a prescription regimen that would hopefully reduce the occurrence and/or frequency of sciatica.  Each bottle contained a 60 day supply with enough refills to last me an entire year.  I have 2 herniated discs, one at L4-L5 and the other at S1.  The herniation at L4-L5 was causing pressure on my sciatic nerve which runs down the length of the left leg.  For me, this drug was not effective; perhaps, if I had continual pain I would learn to live with the side-effects.  I did stop taking any medications for my condition and am learning to cope without prescriptions at this time.  It appears that eventually I will need to take medication but I want to avoid feeling ""doped up"" for as long as possible."
860,valium,6,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,anxiety,"It was beneficial for alleviating nervousness and feelings of anxiety. I took one half tablet or a full tablet depending upon how anxious or nervous I was feeling. If particularly anxious/nervous sometimes I took one tablet plus a half. I didn't take this medication on a daily basis, but only when I was going to be involved in a nerve wracking experience.",Only mild slightly woozy feelings. Exacerbated when I took higher dose of 1 & 1/2 tablets,This medication was prescribed to calm feelings of anxiety and nervousness that I experienced in certain social situations.

I did have reoccuring episodes (TIA like - diagnosed as TIA for lack of conclusive evidence or further investigation)  I now believe it was mostly stress and menopause related issues.,"I do not know that all side effects were attributable to the Clonozapam alone or a combination of one or all drugs.  I did take just the Clonozapm and Lovastatin the first year.   Regardless, everytime I looked up a symptom on the web, it always pointed to MS.  My Neurologist did say we should investigate it, but we never did.  Anyway, I could not sleep for days on end, I had excessive hand tremors, voice tremors, unsteady gait, tintinnitus, eyesight problems, urinary problems, memory problems and a bunch more I can't even recall at the moment.  I weaned myself off the medicine in 3 months time and am very much improved but only after months and possibly years of being removed from all the problems.  I'd like to mention that at one point in time I took the cholesterol drug that Dr. Jarvis promotes...I can't remember the name and had to quit within the first week as it gave me pains in the front of my thighs that could take your breath away.  I know for a fact that that symptom was in fact attributable to that drug.  A good effect that came from that drug though was the almost immediate shrinkage of my breast cysts...I had many on both sides.  Upon starting on that drug, I could actually feel them draining, dissapating or whatever you might call it.  They have not returned, so I am very thankful for that aspect of the drug.  Because of the leg pain though, I found it intolerable.","I am not sure what you mean as I already told you that I was being treated for TIA like seizures with the Clonozapam and Aggrenox as a blood thinner for the same.  I also took Lovastatin for High Cholesterol.  In the course of all these medications I ended up getting a divorce.  The drugs did not lower my cholesterol... they made me more nervous and made me question what on earth was wrong with me?  I now weigh more than I ever have, and I started to gain wieght almost immediately after getting off of the drugs.  I could use to lose 20lbs, but I am not worried about it as I am so much healthier than I was during the time I was on all of the drugs.  I hope this has helped you in some way.  I am sorry that I can't be more specific, but I am in a hurry to put all of that behind me and build a healthier - drug free future.  I am very much a proponent of natural medicines these days!"

Sometimes it would wake me up and other times I didn't even know I was doing it, but the doctor told me that it was still disturbing my sleep.  While taking this drug, my legs and arms only jumped about 3 times in a 6 hr period.  All documented on sleep studies.",I've heard that some people turn into gamblers.  Not a joke.  But I have never had any abnormal urges to gamble while taking it.  I am not a gambling person. In fact the medication has never made me want to do anything wrong or strange and I've never had trouble or side effects at all unless I suddenly stop taking it and then I can't sit still or sleep becuase I am jumping around.,I take a .25mg tablet every a.m. and then around dinner I take another one.  This keeps me from becoming jumpy in the daytime because I used to just be sitting there and my arm or leg would fly up or I'd feel the need to move.  I also take 1 mg at bedtime to stop my legs and arms from jumping in my sleep.  This has improved my quality of sleep immensely.
3446,provera,9,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,irregular menses,The treatment benefits of taking Provera were very good. I had very irregular menses that lasted for long periods of time.  By taking the Provera day 15-26 of my cycle my periods began to normalize and become regular again.,The only side effects I noticed were during the first two days or so of taking Provera I was more tired than usual.  I also noticed I felt more bloated than when I was not taking it.,"On day 15 of my cycle I took the Provera 10 mg for 12 days and then stopped to promote a period.  It took a couple of cycles for this to become effective, but utilizing the drug in this manner did take care of the problem of irregular bleeding in between periods."

It also gave me alot of energy so working out didn't seem like such a chore anymore.  I felt more refreshed and awake in the morning instead of wanting to hit the snooze button over and over.,"At first when I started the phentermine, it made me very thirsty and a little bit jittery but that wore off after about a week.  I also had trouble falling asleep at first if I didn't take the medication early enough in the morning and woke up quite a bit throughout the night. These side effects all diminished after about a month of usage.",First I had to fill out a patient questionaire & submit blood for some blood work that was required.  I was prescribed to take one pill after breakfast in the morning. I also went in for weekly weigh ins and measurements.   They also gave me some vitamins to take along with the phentermine but I did not take those since I hate having to take any kind of pills.  Overall I am very happy with the results achieved from taking phentermine and occasionally take them when I feel myself getting off track again.

I gained weight, developed horrible acne, and i was severely depressed the entire time. When choosing the depo shot i was excited to not have to worry about taking the pill, lightening or stopping my periods, and the guaruntee of contraception. Boy was i wrong. All of the previous side effects were bad enough, but after the first month on the shot, i continued to have my period for nearly 2 months straight. for some reason my period never stopped. The worst part about this contraceptive is that once you take the shot, there is no going back. I highly recommend a different birth control. I am now on the nuvaring and so far i am pleased with the results. Mild nausea at night the first week but that is my only complaint. Much better choice if you are looking to avoid pills. :)",I recieved the shot at family planning about 3 years ago. Please do yourself a favor and look to other options before choosing this drug.

during the medication i received, i was severely depressed, however it got me thinking deeply towards why i was indeed depressed, and thus, i came to a solution.

it completely destroyed the bacteria that was within my abscess and treated me within 3 days, and aided my mind alot.

Within my experience with metronidazole, i have only to thank it for my A* papers and my mental health.

Also I didn't get pregnant, which was the goal. Before getting on birth control I had been a very moody person, fighting often with people who were important to me and whom I really didn't want to fight. On the shot I still had mood swings but they were not nearly as strong.","After getting off the shot it took nearly 2 years to get pregnant with our second child; however that was to be expected as it took over a year to get pregnant with my first (Depo was my first experience with birth control). There was mild weight gain, once I started dieting and exercising I was able to deal with it though. Some mild acne but nothing anyone besides me ever noticed.","I'd visit the doctor's office once a month. At my original clinic, I would simply walk in and a nurse would inject me; after we moved to another state I learned I would have to wait 1.5-2 hours for a doctor to see and inject me, even with an appointment it could take a while.

I've taken other antibiotics in the past and they were much more effective at clearing up my skin.  So I stopped taking the Solodyn.","I haven't taken Solodyn now for a week and I am experiencing very itchy skin, achy joints, and fatigue.  The itchy skin is mostly on my scalp and neck. Today I had itchy hives on my leg as well.  The joint pain is mostly in my right hand and wrist. It hurts to make a fist and then open my hand back up. I've had allergic reactions to other meds before, but they would stop when I stopped the medicine.  For some reason, these nasty side effects are lingering.",none
661,suboxone,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,opioid addiction,"Suboxone is beneficial for two reasons:

1) It eliminated the opiate withdrawal when I was kicking my original drug of choice.

2) As a maintenance drug, Suboxone eliminates the cravings that I would normally have for opioids, as well as blocks the effects of agonist opioids (Heroin, Oxycodone, etc.) so that there is no temptation to take these drugs.

Instead of struggling every day to avoid taking opioid drugs (and all of the terrible thing that come with being in active addiction) I can take Suboxone and move on with life. 

Suboxone may have quite literally saved my life.","My only major complaint is that since Suboxone is an opioid (though different from Heroin, Oxy, etc.) it causes constipation. 

Due to Suboxone's opioid blocking effect, if pain medication were needed in a hospital emergency setting, there could be complications. If I came in to the ER with a broken arm and they gave me a shot of Morphine, it would do absolutely nothing. Though this hasn't been an issue for me yet.","I am a drug addict, and although I went to rehab to get off of opiate drugs I just couldn't seem to stop. So I went on Suboxone, which is a new alternative to Methadone treatment.

While Methadone is a normal agonist opioid ('agonist' means it gets use high) it can be dispensed to drug addicts to keep them from withdrawing from their drug of choice because the Methadone lasts so long. But Methadone must be taken every day at a clinic and cannot be taken home, addicts can STILL use drugs while on Methadone if they choose too, it is EXTREMELY difficult to get off of, and Methadone still gets users high.

Suboxone is a great alternative because it can be prescribed and bought at the pharmacy so you can take it at home, it takes care of your drug cravings but it doesn't get you high (not exactly, anyways, but it does satisfy the Opiate Receptors enough) and it's really not all THAT hard to get off of if you must (the withdrawals are are VERY manageable)."

I look tired and haggard all the time, with enormous eye bags.The pain in my knees became a lot more severe","I was prescribed this medication when the medication I had been taking for 2 and a half years became ineffective.

If the latter being so, then one should wait for the next dosage.","I've experienced no side effects with this medication as in opposition to some others which have given me problems, especially stomach discomfort/upset.

Basically it leveled me out, where the anxiety didn't affect me anymore.","Getting on the drug was tough, because I endured insomnia, sweating, loss of appetite, high-anxiety, shaking, hands, and restlessness.  After about 2-3 weeks, however, all those symptoms went away, once my body got used to it.  I did have some weight gain, but I was really skinny to begin with.","I've dealt with anxiety since I was a kid as well as obsessive thinking.  It continued to build until I was 17 and I had a major panic attack, which I could not calm down from.  My psychiatrist put me on Paxil CR and I worked up to 25 mg.  The dosage made a big difference, though I still had moderate levels of anxiety, but I could function.  About a year and a half ago I was hit with another major attack that send me into a relapse for about 2-3 months, then I upped my dosage to 37.5 mg and within a week I felt fine, even better than I felt before.  Now a year and a half later, I found myself in another relapse and after a week I released that all this time I was not at a high enough dosage because my anxiety and obsessive thoughts would still creep in and cause me distress.  So my psychiatrist agreed that I was not at my ideal dosage and I am now taking two 25 mg in the morning which equals 50 mg, which is still a fairly moderate dosage considering other patients that were on 80 to even 120 mg.  I just started taking it, so I should start feeling even better within about a week or two.  I've accepted that I may need to be on this for the long haul, which is fine.

In my case I did not want to return to the doctors office and be charged again for another consultation + purchase additional amoxilin as I was not covered by medical insurance at that time.
Instead I went to a local pharmacy with the package of antibiotics I received from the doctors office and asked if I could buy 12 tablets. They were more than happy to sell them to me (at a fraction of the cost I paid at the doctors office) and I followed through with a 7 day course.
The results were very positive and within 24 hours I could feel relief and I knew that the infection was being affected by the amoxilin. By the 3rd day the swelling was greatly reduced and other than a nasty wound on my ankle bone I felt very good. I continued the remaining 4 days and besides a scar on my ankle at the site of the infection I completely recovered."

Within a few minutes (15 - 20?) after taking it, I noticed I would feel better, and I'd start coughing up mucus from the lungs.  The feeling wore off after a few hours.  I was able to complete the full 5-day course.","I think I remember not being able to taste very well.  But that could've been a side effect of the flu.

As the medical community acknowledges once you have contacted the virus it will be awaiting an opportunity to break through - especially in times of stress or tiredness. Prior to taking Valtrex I was having a viral herpes attack for about 10 days at a time at least four times a year, sometimes 8 times a year.

Valtrex is an amazing drug!

My experience has been that  if you take a tablet each day you will not transmit the virus to your 
partner provided that you pay attention to the first signs of the virus and abstain from intimate sexual encounters for five days or so or until you can feel or see no more signs of the virus.

To be honest it frustrates me that so many people suffer from this virus but are not informed as to how to treat the problem.

Hope this helps and gives encouragement. For me it has been on par with a miracle.

It was taken after the onset of migraine, usually when I realized that it would not go away via conventional over the counter headache medicines.

Sometimes the patch slips and has come off several times in the bath, so I've had to pull out a new one.  I do not like having to take progesterone separately in pill form, or at all, but with a uterus it is necessary.

I had tried all the natural remedies as I was very concerned about taking a medication:  herbs, soy, etc.  I walked 30 miles a week and did yoga, none of which helped.  In desperation I visited my OB GYN who suggested I go on HRT, stating that quality of life needed to be considered.  Shortly, thereafter, the reports initial study was released, and again I spoke to my doctor who said that she thought the results were over inflated.  I switched to estradiol because it's considered more effective, and the patch bypasses the liver with delivery directly through the skin.  I've since weaned myself off several times, only to have the symptoms return.

One (I can't remember the name) actually lifted my depression almost immediately and made me feel great, but after about 3 weeks I was suddenly plunged into a depression that was darker and more frightening than any I'd experienced before.

Although the pain was not diminished completely, I noticed that when I had severe pain, the meds did absolutely no good.  Perhaps if I'd taken more than the recommended dosage, it would have been effective, but I did not want to do that.  It also had a negative effect on my brain.

2618,buprenorphine,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,major depression,"Subutex is mostly used to help opiate addicts withdrawal more comfortably from opiod drugs such as Vicodin, Oxycodone, and even Heroin. However, I was started on Subutex because my doctor and I were having no luck finding another med that would augment my current depression medications of Effexor XR and Adderall (which were only partially working). My doctor had found research suggesting that Subutex, because it is a partial opiate agonist itself (although much different in its properties compared to what most think of when thinking ""opiate""), binds to one of the opiate receptors in the brain responsible for mood. My doctor has always been on the cutting edge of current research and was extremely open-minded in trying this med with me - and to welcomed relief as well! I have had almost ALL good results from this medication. It has definitely aided in the treatment of my very-treatment-resistent depression. The following are the benefits that I have noticed from taking Subutex:
     1. Quick-acting - because Subutex is sublingual (dissolves under your tongue) it gets into your system immediately and does not have to be processed by your digestive system first.
     2. Gentle effects - I have definitly not experienced any ""highs"". Just a subtle, but noticeable improvement in a feeling of wellbeing.
     3. Also helps somewhat with anxiety by having a calming effect; in normal doses this happens without any tiredness.
     4. Have not noticed ANY of the side effects that I have found with other psychiatric medications such as weight gain/loss, personality changes, sexual effects, etc. Also, in case anyone is worried that Subutex is a ""partial-opiate agonist"", I must emphasize that this med DOES NOT build a tolerance or make you want/need to increase dosage. I have been on this dose for four years without ever even thinking about needing more. HOWEVER!!! You must understand that - as is the case with ALL psychiatric medications - you cannot simply stop taking this medication without tapering your dose first or you will experience withdrawal effects. The one saving grace about Subutex, though, is that it has a very long half-life and will remain in your system long enough to prevent any type of withdrawal even if you miss a day or two of medication.",None.,I take two 8mg tablets in the afternoon by putting them under my tongue and allowing them simply to dissolve.

I have found that it is more effective and works more quickly if I'm able to lay down in quiet when I ""feel"" it starting to work.","My insurance covers it like a normal RX, but it only comes with 10 pills for the duration, but still worth every penny. I have tried ALL KINDS of other migraine meds, with absolutely no success. Zomig was my last hope without seeing a specialist (again) and trying combos of meds. Over the past several months, it has cured almost all of my migraines (it doesn't help sinus headaches, but does help alcohol induced headaches-I get them even after one glass of wine).

2733,elavil,7,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,depression/insomnia,"This medication was prescribed for its side effect of drowsiness.  Although it is mainly used as an anti-depressant, in the tricyclic family, it causes considerable drowsiness at even a low dose of 50mg.  This immediately helped with my insomnia.  It also caused no daytime ""hangover"" effect and the dose can be increased easily.","The major side effect of drowsiness is desirable in my case, but it also has a marked side effect of weight gain.

Still cannot breath. I am now bent over with my hands on my knees struggling to intake air. I took several more puffs from the inhaler. No effect. I am now struggling to remain conscious, I am getting light headed and everything in my vision is pale. I begin to lay on my back, taking a few more puffs of the inhaler. No effect. My throat is now beginning to seize from the sheer force it takes to inhale tablespoon-sized breaths. I have a headache and hear a high pitched whining. I try several more puffs of my inhaler. No effect. I lay on the ground doing controlled breathing for several minutes. I tried a puff of Ventolin HFA here and there with no effect, so I gave it up. I'm laying wondering if this is my last day on Earth. About 15 minutes of pure agony later I catch my breath slightly. I now have an enormous headache and am dizzy. I get to my feet and start to walk toward my apartment (across the street). Along the way, my chest seizes up a couple more times, and a couple more times I use the inhaler. No effect. I now have to wait another month before I can afford a ProAir inhaler before I can even exercise again. I think Ventolin is for underdeveloped little kids who think they have asthma but actually don't. I have real asthma and this stuff almost killed me. The puff that comes out of it is nearly invisible, the puff from a Proair inhaler is actually noticeable and...a 'puff'--about 15x more comes from the Proair compared to the Ventolin. Even waking up in the morning, the slight tightness I have then, Ventolin does nothing for. My girlfriend doesn't understand why I wheeze before AND AFTER I use the Ventolin. Well, it's because it doesn't work for me--in fact, it almost killed me. Everything in this story is true, but I may have taken more puffs from the inhaler than I listed...any ?'s feel free to contact me: thecrookfromthebrook at yahoo.com. Thank you and take care."

I have tried many other medicines, but they either have too much side effect, or don�t work for me at all. This nasal spray clears the congestion in 10 minutes, doesn't last for the whole night, but the pretty pleasant smell make me feel good.","as any other drugs that suppress the immune system, I believe the fluticasone Propionate nasal spray is also make people more susceptible to infections than health individuals. But I guess if the congestion is so bad that one cannot get a quality sleep, it does more harm than the side effect of the nasal spray.","I started using it right before last Christmas, hoping to get better before the holiday. It cleared the congestion for the a few hour after the first time I used it. I keep using it twice a day. for about five days and my nose became much less stuffy and less runny.

I think that this treatment is helping me a lot: now I have a sharper mind, I feel more energetic and I can concentrate properly.","The most annoying side side is insomnia and tremor. I take deprax to induce sleep but even with it I woke up very early. You can get used to some side effects like dry mouth, vivid dreaming and weight loss but tremor, although not serious, is very noticeable. I experienced delayed ejaculation at the begining but not now.","The treatment consists of Cymbalta 60mg and Deprax 50 mg, but it has been changed many times. The most difficult has been to induce sleep for some hours without feeling too sleepy in the morning. I tried with Loramet and Diazepam but their effect last too much, it's impossible to concentrate.

I have been close to remission for a couple of years now, and I attribute it primarily to the Pentasa.","I don't feel as though I have any discernible side-effects with Pentasa, but when paired with Purinethol I do have side effects such as extreme fatigue and headaches, leading me to believe the problem lies with the Purinethol. I do have intermittent constipation, which could be attributable to a number of factors in my life, but is also a side-effect of Pentasa. I also have mild headaches, muscle pain, and anxiety which are listed as possible side-effects with Pentasa, but to the best of my knowledge these symptoms were occuring prior to my starting Pentasa.  Perhaps the Pentasa exacerbates the problems, I don't know.  I know that I do worry about kidney problems, which is one of the more serious side-effects of this medicine.","Twelve years ago I became ill with what was diagnosed two years later (!) as Crohn's disease.  I have used a variety of medications, ranging from more serious drugs (Prednisone, Remicade)to less ""harmful"" drugs (Metronidazole, Ciprofloxacin, Asacol, etc.). I have been on the Pentasa for about 8 years, during which time I was using Purinethol for several years.  A year or so ago I weaned myself off of the Purinethol and remained on the highest dose of Pentasa for my weight, and I am doing well (knock on wood).  I have constipation issues as opposed to my previous diarrhea problems, which may be attributable to the Pentasa, and is manageable through diet and over-the-counter aids."

All of the side effects became persistently worse, starting off as very minor side effects and progressing to a moderate stage.

I was taking klonopin every once and awhile which helped a little, but by the time the klonopin kicked in the attack was over. It got to where I had an attack at least every other day.

Unfortunately, I didn't review the contraindications.","I got a rash on the back of my neck that lasted for 1 year even though I only took Prozac for 2 months. Also, I couldn't sleep as a result of taking Prozac. It seemed like after I stopped taking it I still had it in my body because I couldn't get rid of the rash on my neck and it was very annoying.

1660,climara,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,menopausal,"Climara patch almost completely stopped the severe hot flashes and severe vaginal dryness. It also has improved skin tone and elasticity, moderated mood, improved sleep (by decreasing hot flash frequency). The side-effect of pain in liver area from estradiol by mouth has gone away using a dermal patch.","The only side effect from the Climara is mild itching after removing the patch. Another side effect is actually produced by the progesterone I have to take to balance the estrogen, and that is an aggravation of my IBS - abdominal pain, gas, bloating. So I take the progesterone only 7 days/month now and the side effects are minimal.","After being miserable with frequent (20+ times/day, 7-10 times/night) and severe hot flashes (sometimes like a sudden sunburn, skin turning red and burning) for a number of years, I went on hormone replacement therapy. Estrogen by mouth had more side effects, so I went on the patch, which I have to change only once a week. The recommended accompanying treatment of progesterone caused more problems than the estrogen: a combination patch which is available is more convenient, but I found by trying it that progesterone really aggravates my IBS symptoms. To lessen that effect, I went on an estrogen-only patch and use a separate progesterone only 7 days/month. This is currently making me have periods again, not a fun thing, but I feel much better overall because my IBS symptoms are much less severe and less frequent."
3046,seroquel,8,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,bipolar ii,"Seroquel is the first medication that really seemed to work for me. I have taken it along with several different combinations of meds, but the Seroquel has remained in my regimen for the past 5 years. I play with the dosage and make my own changes (25 mgs at a time) based on how I'm doing, so I've taken between 200 and 400 mgs at any given time. The effects I attribute to the Seroquel include lessening of depression, anxiety and aggression.","Dry mouth, vivid dreams (I remember most of my dreams from the past 5 years), extreme lethargy (the Wellbutron helps counteract that)",I currently take 200 mgs at night before bed along with 200 mgs of Lamictal and Wellbutron.

At half this dose I was fine. But, needed dosage levels are different for different people.",The secret of taking proton pump inhibitors and H2 receptor inhibitors lies in finding the right dosage and the right time of day to take it. Zoton Fast Tabs are tablets which dissolve on the tongue and can be broken to alter the dosage. I found that half my prescribed dosage of 30 mgs/day was enough for me and so break the tablet in two.

The effects, compared to when I was in the episode I'm very stable. Occasional bouts of mild, often topical depression, but otherwise okay. 
As for insomnia, it's gotten to the point where I'm almost dependent on it to sleep. Considering beforehand, even while not in a noted phase I would have serious problems sleeping, this is a welcome effect.","I'm very slow to get going in the morning. I often hit my snooze alarm 10-12 times (only 5 minutes a piece), but that could also stem from setting my alarm 3 hours before I have to be anywhere.

The worst problem of it all is that it stuffs up my sinuses to the point where I can't breathe through them when getting to sleep. Combine that with dry mouth and you get some very uncomfortable nights. I've found that keeping a supply of corn chips and water next to my bed counteracts the dry mouth until I go unconscious and stop caring.

Also, something which I'm not sure if I can blame the seroquel for; I sometimes get very mild but discomforting pains just under my left collarbone. Not like heart-chest pain (from what I'd imagine it's like), but a different pain. Hopefully my heart doesn't explode randomly.","Dec 08- Zoloft, sparked a 3 week long mixed phase with psychotic features. 4 days into it I was prescribed 25 mg seroquel.

Jan 09-April 09, Increasing doses of Seroquel, up to 300. Also Wellbutrin, starting at 50 and eventually reaching 300. The wellbutrin made me considerably more depressed than I was before, and I stopped taking it. Since then it's been the seroquel, and I've been mostly stable since."

By the end of three months, the cyst was completely gone. I'm cyst free since then.","It stopped my menstrual cycle but after three months, my period came as usual so it's not a big problem. But the worst side effect for me was I got acne which was severe and left pitted scars. Not only that, I noticed my skin (whole body and face) after the acne stopped was very very dry and aged very fast. It took long time for my skin to become somewhat normal again. Hairs on my legs were getting longer and more prominent too. And another side effect was weight gain with enormous appetite which you could feel was not normal appetite. I gained about 8kg and then lost it which result in sagging skin on my face.",The treatment was easy enough. The gynaecologist prescribed Danazol for the ovarian cyst I had and it was very effective. The cyst was gone and didn't come back too.

On top of that the packaging is just HORRIBLE!  It comes 9 to a package.  The packaging is a tri-fold ""booklet"" that is very rigid and has individual blisters for each tablet.  It's about 6 1/2 by 3 1/2 inches, folded.  I  like to have migraine meds on me at all times so I ended up cutting the tablets out of the booklet so they would fit in my wallet or purse.

In retrospect, I shouldn't have taken the medication because I was already on a medication to come off of opiates, because I have an addictive personality. I discussed this with my Dr. and he told me that alprazolam with suboxone worked well together. I later found out that the two drugs were dangerous to take together because of the potential of respiratory depression. Also, I've found out that benzodiazepines, especially alprazolam can be very addictive, which can have much worse withdrawal than any opiate. I think alprazolam can be a very useful medication if taken as prescribed and only taken on a prn basis. I don't believe there are any instances where alprazolam should be taken twice a day, unless you have signs of extreme anxiety all day, every day. If you have an addictive personality like myself, I think if you consider alprazolam at all, it should be used very judiciously. But exhaust other alternatives to alprazolam, like buspar, which has no addiction potential, however, I think it tends to be pretty much useless unless taken in high dosages. I suggest talking to two or more dr.s before initiating a regimen. I only say this because I know what alprazolam withdrawal entails, and there are VERY unpleasant side effects, which can be life-threatening. Also, alprazolam isn't effective for very long. It is really only good for extreme panic attacks and helps quickly, then it loses its effect within approx. 2 hours. I will also say gladly, that I have known people who have taken alprazolam for several years and only for extreme panic attacks, and none of them have developed a dependency on them. The bottom line is you know you're propensity to addiction. Use your own common sense and if prescribed, have the dr. start you on .25mg., the lowest dose, and you should see a great difference in your anxiety, especially if your body is not accustomed to benzodiazepines. Best of luck.","lethargy, loss of appetite.","I was started at .5mg, the second strength of dosage, 2 times daily. I became afraid of it because I was taking it to calm me from coming down off opiates, however, I was already on a medication to stop me from taking opiates, which was actually not supposed to be taken with alprazolam because of concerns that both medicines cause respiratory depression."

Over the 3-week treatment period, there was about a 25 percent reduction in the size of the cysts. There was also a mild reduction in the pain associated with the cysts. 

Another benefit was that I did not get upper GI pain & bleeding with this med, whereas NSAIDs had been causing black stools due to GI irritation & bleeding.","Within about 30 minutes of taking each dose of Sulindac, I experienced a colicky pain under my ribs on the right side.  The pain was not extreme, but it was noticeable and unpleasant.  Duration lasted 2 - 4 hours each time.  This side effect persisted throughout the entire treatment period.","Due to longstanding knee osteoarthritis, I am prone to fluid-filled cysts on the backside of my knees.  The cysts cause pain, swelling, and reduced circulation to the lower leg.  The cysts interfere with walking gait as well.

In past I had used NSAIDs to reduce the inflammation of these cysts, however due to NSAID-related side effects, this class of drug was put off-limits by my physician.  His recommendation was that I try a drug in the pro-NSAID class, which is less irritating to the stomach.

In retrospect, I think that for me, the Sulindac was a trade-off: less stomach irritation exchanged for liver irritation with the Sulindac.  Due to this side-effect, my doctor reduced frequency of medication to once per day.  My response to the Sulindac was less robust than I had hoped for -- much less improvement than I had experienced previously with NSAIDs -- and it also took a long time (3 weeks) to reach the level of improvement that in past I would achieve in 3 days with OTC NSAIDs."

I got up to use the bathroom a few times on this medication and once I fell into the bathtub and also have fallen asleep on toilet if I have gotten up to use the bathroom.

1067,botox,5,Highly Effective,Severe Side Effects,for wrinkle (line) reduction,"Botox was administered to help reduce the lines appearing on my forehead and at the outer side of my eyes- crows feet.  The 100 and 50 unit injections were effective in reducing the lines for a period of about 5 months, but there were noticeable adverse reactions with the 100 units.  The 50 units were as effective but without the spasms noted under Treatment Details.  OF the 2 times 50 units were injected,  the last time the botox had been reconstituted for more than the recommended 4 hours.  There was concern of effectiveness, but actually it seems as though the botox was more quickly effective, and seemed more effective in reducing the lines that the previous 50 unit injection.  More detail is covered under the treatment details.","Side effects were twitching of eyes, especially upon smiling,,, spasms of cheeks.  Blurry vision.  This lasted for approximately 3 days.","The first use of botox was 100 units. Injections were 5 injections on the upper-mid forehead. 3 injections were given around the outer side of each eye. Within 2 hours it was difficult to close my eyes.  The forehead was totally stiff. Upon smiling and talking my cheek muscles were noticably twitching.  Eye lids twitched, friends noticed my face spasming.
   I make note of this issue because of the fact concerning the stability of the botox.  I realize that botox is available in 50 or 100 unit vials, which are then reconstituted. The nurse stated that he had to use all of the botox (apparently he only had the 100unit vial)because it would be instable after 4 hours.    
   Since this time, I have had 50units of botox at two different times, injected in the same areas stated above.  There was no adverse spasms, be definite ""freezing"" of the forehead muscles.  The 100 units and 50 units lasted about 4-5 months before lines started to appear again due to frowning, smiling, etc.   I recently had only 10 units injected mid-upper forehead in 2-3 injections. Upon raising my eyebrows I needed (I thought) injections more lower mid section since the upper forehead did not move.  After one month, I find that I have a few lines above my eyebrow but in general, my forehead is less lined.
  My MAIN CONCERN is :  if physicians, agents  have only 50 - 100unit vials available, and they are only injecting 1 client, what do they do with the residual.  Is this why there is such a high cost  $11 - $15 per unit??  It makes me wonder if physicians are freezing or using the botox beyond the 4 hour expiration time.  Have manufacturers ever thought of packaging smaller unit packages to assure clients are getting ""the real"" stuff.  This last physician did not have the manufacturer's bottle for me to see, only a small syringe already pre-filled."

Through the past two years I was diagnosed with Shuermann's Kyphosis, a degenerative back disease in the lower spinal column. Throughout the past two years I have been on and off intensive narcotic pain killers, Ie. Vicodin ES,Percocet,MS Contin etc.. I knew enough was enough, so like that I stopped taking them. I have no side effects whatsoever. I have been through and still ongoing physical therapy ( 4th session 1 session is 3 weeks ) and been too four Orthopedic doctors and spinal specialists. My doctor and I discussed a long term pain application to get me off taking narcotics. I am no pro, but I know that opiates are the best for bad chronic pain, which i experience every day in my life. My doctor and I talked about Cymbalta which can be used to tone down the pain level sensors in the brain so I am not experiencing so much pain. I also have high levels of depression, and anxiety. Recently my Aunt and Uncle passed away which they practically raised me when I was born in Ireland, and my Sister's deaths was even more of a add on. I felt myself slipping into a deep black hole, and was looking for cheap thrills just to keep myself from going crazy ( literally ). Anyways, it has been my third day on this prescription, and I feel like a new person. I find myself enjoying simplistic things, and taking initiative in my life to pursue my goals and education. I am currently unemployed and as a young adult it is very hard to maintain money flow with no job. I am enrolled and taking college courses which I have 2 more semesters left before I receive my degree. In one of my classes (Chemistry) We are assigned a Science experiment. Mine, will be for depression and pain levels which will I am using Cymbalta. I recorded myself for two weeks, and then the first day after each dose of the drug. I am feeling alive, and that classical person everyone enjoys being around. I have read a lot about this drug and how it fails or makes situations worse. But for me it is working, and I am consistent in my daily routine. I shall continue to document all of my feelings and side effects from this prescription.","I have no side effects at the moments. This drug is being used for a dual purpose action as stated in my recordings. I feel that this has a mixed review. For me I was given two weeks of trials, and then 10 refills. So my advice to any of you, is to ask your care giver for a sample of any drug you take before you make it a routine pill. It takes 3-6 weeks for a Human to become physically and mentally dependant. I am very pleased overall otherwise.","1 pill (30mg) Per day, in the morning."

Shortly afterwards, blisters appeared and the skin began to be infected. My doctor prescribed Cipro, which not only did not work but caused my lips to be extremely swollen, so swollen that the skin on my lips split in a few places and bled. I could actually easily see my swollen lips by simply casting my eyes downward. I stopped taking the Cipro and reported the condition to my doctor, who was at a loss to explain why the Cipro did not help my skin infection."

657,seasonique,1,Ineffective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,have not stop bleeding,,Bleeding not even Spotting,"Ladies: I am sure you may have done lots of researches by now regarding taking Seasonique (PLEASE do before you try to take this drug), and there are lots of negative than positive comments on this drug. I would like to point out a couple of my comments to share with you. I normally have 4 - 5 days menstrual periods every month. But I was not happy and tried to be on this drug because it described 4 periods only per year (WOW! what a great idea, especially I have small child, school, work, and husband). Guess what happen since then? I have been bleeding almost 2 weeks now, and from light to heavy, the worst part is I get all these uncomfortable cramps, keep waking up at night, my personalities change from good to bad, I have not been in a good mood since then. of course not, how can I be in a good mood when my vagina keeps bleeding on me every single day (I am sure no woman likes that), and so on. I spoke with my OB, and she said it's normal. I don't think so, it is completely not normal to me. I have been bleeding, and ruin my daily life style. No wonder it is called Birth Control. How can you have sex with your partner while you have all these symtomps in your body especially bleeding? I stop this drug, and can't wait to have my clean dates back.

Ladies: I am not saying all the women's body are the same. But if you want to be on this drug. I would advise you do more researches and read more comments before trying, and other advise is if you think it's a good idea for 4 periods per year, you may want to think twice. Because it's a mother nature for women that has 13 menstrual periods every year, trying to change it and playing with your hormones are the game, unless you like to gamble, then you may want to try this excitment drug, and hope you will win. Otherwise, please consider something else. I am so regret that I did not read all the comments and reviews before I asked my OB to put me on this drug. Therefore, I have to suffer what I deserve (I guess). I just don't want to see another woman to be suffered like me, as I finally found out there are lots of women out there are taking the same drug (before I made up my mind to throw this drug away) that are suffering the same symtomps but still want to continue and hopefully that will work one day. For me, ""no is no"". You can call me chicken or looser or whatsoever. But let me tell you, it is defintely not fun if the drug makes your life changes from okay to worse!

Final words...... Good luck if you are on this prescription, and I hope you win, if not, you defintely need these words ""Good Luck""! :)"

We are hoping our daughter can get testing to determine if her seizures are catamenial in nature.  She was on carbatrol with complete control, but was switched to Keppra due to her upcoming marriage (much lower risk of birth defects and ability to use birth control pills while on it).  She was completely weaned off of Carbatrol at one point and went almost 8 weeks with no seizure activity.  She also went 5-1/2 months with no seizure activity with Keppra before having a tonic clonic seizure.  Due to her history of seizures (started at the age of 14 a couple of months after she started her period), and the ability to go for long periods of time without problems, we wonder if she is having extreme spikes in estrogen when she ovulates from time to time. We hope that our neurologist will work with an endocrinologist and gynocologist to see if there is some validity to our theory.

She is dyslexic too.  She was put on Zoloft to help control her anxiety and panic attacks.  I think it helped, however she became numb to a lot of social norms.  She never did anything terrible, but I always felt that she would do something inappropriate.  We d/c her Zoloft at the beginning of the summer of 2007.  We weaned her off per the dr's instructions.  She is much more normal now.  Minor anxiety and a lot more normal as far as social skills and obeying social norms."
2985,strattera,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,add,"Greater focus, stronger commitment, lessened stress, improved self-confidence, goal setting, less depressed, better organization and memory (as in remembering events), clearer in thought and expression thereof.","Lower regard for self-value, naturally depressive concepts seem less far-fetched, appear less happy.","With or without this medication I am a philosopher. So I will be explain how the drug works on me from a philosophical assessment.

Background:
I had taken Strattera for three years (2005-2007) where it helped control ADD where I had difficulty doing so. It helped me focus, stay organized, manage relations, and most or all of the benefits I listed prior. I dropped the drug for 3 years so that I may learn how to control my ADD without the help of medication. During those three years I gained remarkable self control in overcoming ADD. However, I got to the point where I couldn't win over ADD, which was losing focus randomly. During college lectures that I found very intriguing I would often zone out/space out when I could not have been more interested in what was being professed. The frustration of this led me to conclude that medical assistance was the best choice.

On the drug:
I read and understand that the (generally) biggest con--side effect--to this drug is that there is some sort of depressive or suicidal figure involved. From an evaluative standpoint of myself, I've concluded that my desire for happiness is lowered from where it was prior to the drug. In other words, if I felt a need for a happiness at a 9th strength before, I now had the need for happiness at a 5th strength. Since happiness, to me and most I'd say, is the driving force for existence in life, a lessened desire for it would lead to two results. Lessened feeling for the needing to exist/live and feeling less depressed (because I now do not need to be happy as much as before).

Understand that this drug does not control me, I control this drug. I suggest that while you take the medication you assert a greater self-awareness. As you examine how it affects you, you can understand when you are thinking naturally or by the drug."

I tried topical anti-itch creams and put ice on it to soothe the itching but nothing relieved my symptoms more than slightly. I thought it would eventually go away by itself. After suffering for 4 or 5 weeks I went to my doctor. He took 1 look at my arms and said I had hives. Probably due to seasonal allergies. He wrote a prescription for Zantac and sent me on my way.

Swelling was substantially lowered after a week period and steps were taken to allow the ankle to regain flexibility due to subsiding of pain.,There were no treatment side effects except for occasional nausea or drowsiness.

I take it about 2.5 hours before I actually want to get to sleep, and it lulls me into a very deep sleep. I rarely remember dreams. Seroquel has an amazing ability to erase memories of the day before, which for me is usually a good thing.

107,celebrex,3,Ineffective,Mild Side Effects,knee pain,I did not experience any benefits after one week of usage.  I chose to discontinue the treatment.,Some mild stomach irritation.,"The knee pain became progressively more severe over the course of 2-3 months. My family doctor sent me to physical therapist who stress tested the knee, and the physical therapist determined that I should see the specialist.  A consultation with an orthopedic doctor was scheduled with an MRI performed.  The MRI showed some swelling in the knee joint ligaments under the front of the knee cap.  No tears or spurs were visible, thus the diagnosis was possible early stage of arthritis and/or minor injury.  I felt the arthritis was not completely impossible but more likely that some possible injury was probable owing to my daily work activity but no exact injury could be documented.  After the week of celebrex usage, without any noticable relief, I chose to discontinue the medication route in favor of some time off (2 weeks) with ice-pack heat-pad therapy to reduce swelling and pain. Next I self applied sparingly over time some physical therapy at the local gym, to strengthen any possible sprain-injury situation that may have occurred. To date my knees have been relatively trouble free when i adhere to age appropriate work and leisure pursuits (reducing strenuous projects as i get older). My construction business is slowest in late fall and winter, during which i continue my physical activity at a local gym.  Thus avoiding future injuries."

Drinking a whole bottle of water with that metallic-taste made me vomit and that taste is still there when you wake up in the morning but goes away after you've been awake for 10-15 minutes. Occasionally, I will have hangover-like symptoms like feeling nauseated, depressed, and constant headaches all day long. If you miss one night, you will not be able to get any sleep at all. I've gone 72 hours without sleep once because I ran out and the pharmacy took forever to refill it. In the mornings when you wake up, you will need at least 4 cups of coffee to get out of bed. I've tried everything from reducing the dosage to sleeping earlier than normally and nothing helps to prevent that problem.

At the beginning it did relieve the pain and helped me to sleep.,"It wasn't long until I became physically and psychologically dependant on the drug and the treatment became much worse than the problem for which it was prescribed.  Soma is listed as a muscle relaxant which is quite misleading. Because it has been cleverly marketed, it is readily prescribed (or was) and very accessible. I think many pain management physicians prescribe soma for their patients without much thought as to the risks.  The major adverse affects is the rapid tolerance developement and short term memory loss.  There were a number of times that I'd forgotten if /or how much I had taken, which on one occasion precipitated an emergency room visit. It should be classified as a schedule 2 drug at least because of the potential for abuse and overdose. I think this drug should be taken off of the market.",There aren't any treatment details.  The pain management physician prescribed the medication each monthly visit and increased the dosage not long after introducing the drug as treatment.  These kinds of physicians are really drug dealers cloaked in an DEA approved office.

Finally, the doctor gave me permission to stop taking because I was afraid the physical symptoms were going to negatively impact my job.  Had my blood checked last week after one month off the medication and numbers showed I was back in hypothyroidism.  Doctor is mystified at my symptoms, which for the most part seem to be the opposite of what they should have been on the medication.

3036,seroquel,8,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,bipolar i,"The benefits were numerous, I don't have panic attcks for the first time in 20 yrs, and if I do, they are less than 20 seconds.  I haven't had a mixed state or very rapid cycling since getting on it 2 years ago.  These symptoms continued to get more severe until I got on this drug.  Every episode was worse and lasted longer.  This drug gave me my life back.  I lost my job(s) and wound up in psychiatric inpatient care.  But I have become steadily better since first taking the drug.  I have to admit, to get to the point I'm at now took 2 years, but it's better then I was, and it's better than not getting better at all.  The longer I'm on Seroquel, the better I feel.  Also, I am able to sleep because of Seroquel.  At the worst when I went into the hospital I couldn't sleep at all which was making my episode even worse.  Sleeping drugs and benzodiazepines such as valium that were given to me made me feel horrible, very tired the next day, and even made me panic.  Anticonvulsants and even other psychotics gave me panic attacks, made me antsy or made me so tired I couldn't even function in day to day life.  Seroquel doesn't make me real tired, but it  has made a sleep schedule possible again.  I also don't feel too tired in the morning.","There are side effects of course, as there are with any drug.  I have a little more stomach troubles than what I started with but that could be due to the Lithium.  I have also had about 20 pounds of weight gain.  Before the seroquel I was thin with a high metabolism.  My weight is steady now, but at 20 lbs higher than it used to be.  I tried losing the weight but it has been impossible to get it off.  The drug doesn't make me groggy but I know some people on it that it just knocks out.","I have been on and off lithium and paxil for years.  I tried zyprexa, depakote Triliptal and Lamictal, but these made meunfunctionally tired or I had severe reactions to them.  I have a problem where drugs create severe reactions and sensitivity in me so dr.s give small amounts of several rather than a mega dose of one.  I tried Risperdal but it gave me severe panic attacks and restlessness.  I started out with an antipsychotic and lithium at the hospital to bring the mania and mixed states down.  Later I switched to seroquel and Paxil was added to help with my anxiety and depression.  I was on Seroquel at a lower dose than most 200mg to start, 900mg lithium (anymore than that makes me very sick even though the blood tests show it's within normal limits)and Paxil at 25mg.  Now 2 years later, as I am not in a severe episode I can get by on half the Paxil, 50 mg Seroquel and the lowest Lithium possible to keep it in treatment range.  I raise the doses if I have to (with permission of the Nurse practitioner)and I take 25-50mg Seroquel as needed throughout the day if I need to for anxiety, although I don't need to very often.  The combination of seroquel, Paxil and lithium works best together for me."

From there I would become extremely manic and focus only on organization, my eating disorder and cleaning. This hasn't happened at all since taking provigal in combination with Cymbalta. I did read that this medication is not recommended for people with a history of mania, ocd or eating disorders....but I feel that it's been very effective in the long run for me.","Acne!!!!!!!!!! ACNE!!!!! I had a bit of anxiety when I first began taking it, but that has since gone away. My heart raced for a couple of weeks, but It's hard to tell if it really was the provigil simply because my heart often races at random. I had a bit of trouble sleeping the first 3 nights after taking provigil, but this hasn't been a problem AT ALL since. I have lost some weight that I had gained back just before starting provigil, and this has left my husband and therapist a little concerned, but I still get hungry and have not changed my diet...but the provigil IS the cause and I have no doubt about it. I did not refill it for three weeks earlier this year and gained nearly 10 pounds...so this drug would be fairly effective for weightloss.","My bipolar disorder is often at the lowest points more than the highest points anymore. In the past I switched moods much more rapidly and was given the diagnosis of Rapid cycling bipolar disorder. After my first daughter was born it only got worse. Weeks without any sleep! Then when my second daughter was born something changed within me. I couoldn't wake up at night to even hear her cry. My husband took vacation time to stay home to let me rest. I relapsed worse than ever with my eating disorder and required my 3rd feeding tube and I just could not function enough to even take care of myself, normal life or even my baby girls. I was go into fits of rage from the sheer exhaustion and would CLEAN FOR DAYS AND WEEKS without eating , drinking, sleeping or even sitting! Then I would crash! Finally my doctor decided to jusy try provigil, and it has helped a great deal along with cymbalta. I'm not sure why becasue according the everything I know about both medications...they are completely wrong for me. However, nothing else has worked thu far. I have taken EVERYTHING! This has been a dream for me even if I don't have as much pep in my step as I would like....I'm not a blank, lifeless, useless zombie."

Some days were still worse than others, but overall a dramatic difference. I could function throughout the day, wasn't almost falling asleep all the time. If work got crazy and I had to pull 14-16 hrs - which was quite frequent - I didn't get immediately sick.  I actually flew on planes multiple times without getting sick. I used to blink and get sick because my system was so run down despite many hours of sleep a night. When I take xyrem I need only 6-8 hours of sleep and I would wake up and feel great throughout the day. It was an absolute lifesaver for me.","I had a moderate number of side effects that were bothersome but not serious: Oily skin and hair, acne was worse in the beginning, excessive night time sweating - i would wake up drenched every night, acid reflux - this was on and off - tension and anxiety was increased during waking hours. I had teeth sensitivety that developed after starting the drug, rapid pulse (this was weird but it was never a bother), I lost a few lbs and I could eat whatever and not gain much weight. My testosterone levels went way high - not high enough to turn into a boy, but high enough to grow more body hair in places I didn't want and had some hair loss at the temples. I also had problems with short term memory, though I did before when I was in a fibro-fog too. So off the medicine I have a heck of a time still because it is back to fibro fog.  It is a shame because i used to have a great memory.","I would take 3 gms before bed. Wake up 2.50 to 4 hrs later for second dose.  It was easy to wake up, many times I would wake up on my own. Sometimes I would try to wake up too early and would just sleep through my alarm and then wake up closer to the 4 hr mark. If I didn't have a busy job it would just be ideal to try to get closer to 8 or more hrs of sleep every night. That was not always practical for me. I started off at the 3 gms dose twice per night and never had to change. Sometimes, depending on the time of month I got less sleep with the dose - i would awake after only 2.5 hrs later and get around 5 hrs of sleep a night. Depending on where it was with my cycle, sometimes I couldn't wake up so I would lessen my second dose to 2.25 gms so I could wake up at 4 hrs after the dose."

I began taking high doses of Tetracyclean at age 20. By age 30 I was also adding clindamycin topical solution to help control or dry out the breakouts. Even so, this combined effort was only mildly effective. I never drank alcohol, caffeine, and avoided spicy food while drinking lots of water and having a healthy lifestyle. By age 38, I was introduced to Minocyclean which was immediately effective and controlled my acne/ rosacea. Within 4-5 years, my teeth began to grey, weight gain began, and severe bruising developed on my upper and lower legs. Two weeks ago I phased out of the Minocycline and adopted a strong Probiotic ( 15 billion mc of acidophilus, etc. ) regimen with additional herbal supplement to treat yeast and parasites. I continue to use the topical Clindamycin, and so far the result is very controlled and manageable skin. I am monitoring my teeth and anxious to see if the bruising disappears before long. Antibiotics use create yeast in our bodies, which Acne and Rosacea thrive on. Rid yourself of the drugs, and use the natural supplements instead, and eliminate irritating triggers.

The Doctor Prescribed 50mg, and still no difference. Finally, I was prescribed 75mg and have been taking that dosage for about 2 months.I do sleep a little better than before, but I still do not sleep through the whole night.","I would wake up and could not fall back to sleep. Also, I have had an appetite out of this world. I have noticed some weight gain, dry mouth, very vivid dreams, and even periods of hallucinations, and memory loss. I also have had the worst migraines that I have ever had in my life for weeks at a time.",Take one 75mg pill at night.
2278,lexapro,1,Ineffective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,clinical depression,The treatment benefits were very minimal because of the severe rage that I experienced. I don't think I benefited at all from taking this drug.,"This drug was very toxic to my system because it caused severe rage. I really was never relieved from my clinical depression because I kept hoping that the drug benefits would kick in and kept on taking it until one day I realized that I had to stop taking it. After about 2 months, I realized that I was very agitated constantly. I just thought that it would eventually go away but it never did. My nervousness was getting extreme. One day, I was in a grocery store shopping, pushing a grocery cart, and a little boy walked in front of me pushing a toy cart. I was so agitated that I had an INTENSE DESIRE to ram him with my shopping cart. I realized that this behavior was NOT ME and that the Lexapro was causing the severe rage. I also had a constant desire to start running down the street as fast as I could and NOT stop. I also couldn't sleep at night and if I was able to go to sleep finally, I would only stay asleep for a few hours. I sure hope this medication is taken off the market because it could cause some unstable patients to take other's lives from the severe rage.","This medication is manufactured by Forest Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a subsidiary of Forest Laboratories, Inc. in St. Louis Missouri 63045. I was given the prescription of taking 10 mg. once a day. I cannot even imagine what would have happened to me if I had taken the full dosage recommended of 20 mg. I would have probably hurt someone badly. I have always suffered from clinical depression and have taken many different medications. Right now, Paxil is helping me with my depression a little. I think that I need to have it ""upped"" because the usual dosage isn't as effective as it once was. Anyway, my psychiatrist prescribed Lexapro for me because he really believed that this new drug would be just perfect for me. I had no idea that it would cause such turmoil in my life. I was in a constant state of nervousness and my panic attacks had started to get much worse. I just thought that my daily routine was the cause for my anxiety but realized when I had the desire to shove my shopping cart into a little boy who walked in front of me in the store, as I stated before in this report, that I had to quit taking Lexapro. Sometimes, I would sit on my sofa at night and want so badly to just scream at the top of my lungs. My therapist just told me to take a pillow, put it over my face, and scream at the top of my lungs. I was afraid that my neighbors would call the police if they heard me. That was no way to live. This medication was so toxic to me that if I had not realized what it was doing to me, I might have even taken my own life. Because of my great faith in God, I didn't kill myself and finally realized that I had to call my doctor immediately the next morning to report what Lexapro was doing to me. I also have a friend who is taking Lexapro and has taken it for sometime. She also shows signs of rage at times. Just a minor infringement on her and she will go into a state of rage (but not as bad as I did). I have tried to tell her that she needs to get off Lexapro but she just thinks that OTHER people are intimidating her. One day, when she rams her car into someone elses because they pulled in front of her, she will finally realize that Lexapro is not the drug for HER either. I really do think that Lexapro should be taken off the market until further testing is done. I would NEVER recommend this drug to anyone. It is just too unstable."

Had been perscribed many SSRI'S, due to depression but never fully treated for bi-polar because I felt like I deserved and did not want to give up the few highs I had when not depressed. I also did not believe I was bi-polar when dignosed 12 years ago as an in-patient, because I had no understanding of mixed episodes and rapid cycling. I thought when I was hypo-manic, it was just a great relief and celebration of not being depressed. I was also not honest about my alcohol abuse until about 6 months ago, and have since stopped drinking, which allowed me to realize I was quelling the manis with alcohol, and with out it I was more unstable and manic.

It took about 3 days for the drug to take effect but once it did, it kept the wrinkles at bay for approximately 6 months."
3431,tazorac,9,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,"acne, photoaging","This is probably the best skin care product/medicine available. It is highly effective for both acne and photo-aging. It exfoliates the skin better than anything else, thus unclogging the pores. It also speeds up cell turnover, which reduces keratinization, preventing comedo-formation. It smooths out wrinkles, makes the deep layers of skin - dermis - thicker, increases collagen production, etc. You can read about all its benefits on PubMed. It has been proven more effective than tretinoin (Retin A) for both acne and photoaging.","Initially it is quite irritating, that is why it is VERY important to start using it less often and with a smaller applied amount. Do not overdose on Tazorac or else your skin - the upper horny layer, statum corneum - will become so thin and dry that it will crack - thus you will actually CREATE wrinkles rather than eliminate any. If you take it slowly and gradually increase the dose, you won't have that problem, as the skin adjusts to it. You should probably start using it only every 3rd or 4th day initially, gradually increasing to every other day or even every day. Some people are able to use it twice a day; I know I cant. In case you develop severe irritation, you must use a good moisturizer to prevent wrinkle formation. If you are using it for acne, and are using other products such as benzoyl peroxide - as you should, you should be even more careful, as skin irritation is cumulative from the various drugs. You will have to use a lower dose BP such as 2.5% because your skin will be exfoliated and more easily irritated.","The gel is more effective than the cream, in that it delivers a higher dosage of the medication faster. The cream however has lower side effects and it achieves more controlled release of the drug. I believe the cream is more appropriate for anti-aging, as it is more emollient. Neither the cream nor the gel are comedogenic so acne sufferers should not worry. I have used both the gel and the cream, with both concentrations - .05% and .1%. I am currently using the .1% cream. There is a generic version available from an Indian manufacturer called Glenmark. Their product is called Tazret. It is virtually the same as the original."

With Botox injections administered by a very knowledgable neurologist who is also a pain specialist, I am virtually migraine-free for months.",Sometimes I had some minor swelling at an injection site.  It went away within days.,"My neurologist injects the tiny cranial muscles as well as muscles along my neck and upper shoulder.  He uses a tiny needle and injects very little at each site.  He determines where the trigger points are before administering the Botox.  PLEASE NOTE:  If using Botox for migraines, do go to a neurologist who is experienced with migraine pain.  DO NOT have this done by a cosmetic surgeon!"
345,neurontin,9,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,spinal injury,"The Lidoderm numbs my back for most of the day so that the pain is dulled dramatically.  The Neurontin eventually blocked my pain so well I was able to get out of bed after being stuck in it for 4 1/2 months.  These two pain relievers work so very well together.  There is nothing that is going to take all of the pain away.  I am also on other medication for this as well. Being able to walk around again finally, was like, what took you so long to figure it out what to do?  I'm not broken, I'm hurt.  I have children at home, I need to at least be mobile!","Many of the medications I take have a side effect that affects your memory.  My short term memory is terrible.  I can be asking for something as ordinary as a fork, a pen, etc. and can not come up with the word, at all.  I'll be able to later, or the next day, I haven;t forgotten the word, I just can;t get it out of my brain.  The Neurontin has also affected my eyes.  I sometimes have problems focusing; sometimes I am able to read the phone book and othertimes I need magnifying glasses.  This all started a week after starting the medicine.","I have a torn lumbar disk.  I have pain in my back that is constant and gets worse with overwork and high humidity.  I have no feeling in my feet.  My right leg does not work correctly.  The Neurontin is mainly attributable to the quality of life that I have today.  Then the other medications I take all do their part.  The Nerontin blocks the pain nerve signal from registering in my brain.  The Methodone deals directly with the pain as does the Lidoderm Patch.  The muscle relaxer keeps my muscles from spontaneously contracting, which they will do without the medication.  The anti-depressents help me stay positive, which is where I want to be.  I usually have a sunny outlook and the medicine helps me keep it.  When my last medicine stopped working, I was depressed for a total of 6 months.  What a waste of time."

I no longer want to withdraw from the world and now face the world with much more confidence. For people worried that this drug produces an ""artificial"" feeling of happiness--this is not the case.

On day 4 we both experienced waves of strong abdominal pain every hour or so accompanied by a need to go to the toilet with diarrhoea (but it was non-urgent need to go to the loo - like a normal upset tummy can be).,"Initially believing that it was a normal holiday tummy upset we starved ourselves for nearly 4 days (we were also not hungry) but the waves of pain did not significantly subside - triggered by drinking water.   We then arrived at a Hotel in Vietnam that had Internet access and looked at some lonelyplanet blogs - the advice on Malarone was to make sure to follow the medication instruction leaflet to the letter i.e. to take it with a ""milky"" drink.   We then began to take it at breakfast with as many dairy products as we could - yoghurt, cheese, milk on cereal etc, and the symptoms subsided.  The pain ceased after a couple of days but we continued to have violent, liquid bowel movements for another week...  
It would help if the leaflet explained why dairy is recommended - is it the fat that is required or the alkaline environment?"

Also, I gained about 5 pounds after going on the pill, but lost it eventually by upping my exercise and watching closer what I ate.

When I first got on this birth control, I had an intense craving for eggs and ate eggs 3 weeks straight. Again, I don't know if I'm imagining things but I would lose 5 pounds during the sugar pill? Maybe it's because I'm tired all of the time.","I always take the pill at night with lots of water. I am told Yasmin increases the amount of potassium and extra water will flush out the excess. This could be a problem because there's been rumors (not confirmed, but rumors) Yaz might have to be either modified or off the market because of this, according to my doctor. It's expensive, I'm not going to lie. I pay almost 70 bucks per month because I have no insurance.

My hands looked worse than anyone else's my age (or older!).  My hands now looks pretty good/very good!","As the age spots scabbed up, they peeled off, and left my hands red, raw and sore.  One night, the burning feeling was so intense, I had to wash it off.  I was quite worried, as this medicine was out of date, and I thought perhaps it had become dangerous.  Originally it was prescribed for my daughter's acne, but I had read online that it might be helpful for age spots.","I applied a small amount, probably more than I needed to, to the back of each hand for several nights in a row.  Before many nights had passed, I noticed that the skin around each age spot was beginning to become dry and peeling.  Before long, the age spots just seemed to peel off, as did some spots that were more like small moles or very dark freckles.  Although I was concerned that I had severly burned and scarred my hands (they looked very bad for more than a month), now they look great.  In fact, the left one, which was the worse one, improved more than the right hand!"

3705,ranitidine,9,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,gastro esophageal reflux disease (gerd),"I began suffering from ""heartburn"" in my late thirties. This condition progressed to a daily occurence. Not willing to avoid spicey foods my physician prescribed ranitidine. I recall he intially prescribed 150mg twice daily. At one point he recommended 300mg twice aday. But 150mg twice daily is working. The dosage reduced the occurence of heartburn (my symptoms)to near zero.","I am not aware of any side effects. However that does not mean I have not experienced any. I think headaches are a side effect and I get them occasionally, but I cannot tie it to the medication. In any case I do not experience any kind of debilitating medical problems or even annoying ones that I can link to taking ranitidine.","I take a 150mg tablet in the morning before or during breakfast and then another at lunch. This combination prevents heartburn throughout the day. Late night dinners may produce heartburn, often I'll take a tablet prior or immediately after as prevention. Also I elevated my bed about 2"" at the head to prevent what had been fairly frequent events of stomach acid somehow working its way into my mouth at night. This drug and the elevated bed has reduced this to a very rare occurence, and again often associated with late evening meals if I do not take a tablet in the evening."

Sometimes the reflux was so severe that I could not sleep. I changed my diet and tried many drugs, including ranitidine, Prilosec and Pepcid AC--none of whic helped. Although Nexium is very similar to Prilosec in its formulation, for some reason Nexium allowed my esophageal lining to heal and after a one month treatment, my heartburn is much better as long as I continue to watch my diet.","With Prilosec, I occasionally had stomach cramping and nausea, but I did not experience any side effects with Nexium.","I took 1 capsule (40 MG) of Nexium daily for 30 days. Because my heartburn was typically worse in the evenings and at night, I took it in the late afternoon about 45 minutes prior to dinner. After one month, the improvements have been quite noticeable and I have been able to switch back to less powerful, over-the-counter medications."

Cold hands/feet, white face. Bad taste in mouth. Fuzzy in the beginning. Nothing serious so far.","So far the treatment is only to take one tablet a day, and occasionally an Oxazepam in the first two weeks, if I am afraid of falling back into a depression. I started taking both for the first three days, but will soon leave off the Oxazepam. We'll see what happens, it can be followed on my above-mentioned blog. In any case so far I am happy I am taking this medication, I feel much better. I was severely depressed when I started taking it, but the depression seems quite suppressed now."

These included severe stomach cramping and nausea, a severe yeast infection, vomiting, diarrhea and chills.  These side effects began within approximately twelve to twenty four hours after first dose of augmentin was administered.  These side effects were intolerable and somewhat worse than the symptoms from the initial infection.","Augmentin was administered at a dosage of 500 mg to be taken two times a day.  Total treatment time was to be 10 days, but within 24 hours, the side effects of the antibiotic were so intolerable that, after 3 days, the drug was terminated and a different antibiotic was administered."

But even if you wait till the cold sore is larger, it still stops the growth of cold sores completely, and helps to heal pretty quick. id say within 2-3 days. Its so worth it if you are like me, and get cold sores ALLLLL the time. (at LEAST 10 times a year, no joke) I have to have the medicine with me at all times.

In fact it seemed to make me more anxious.,Anxiety,I was prescribed this because of anxiety and mild depression by my GP but it did not improve my condition and seemed to make my anxiety worse.  My anxiety was partly due to my personality and partly due to the fact that I had a mentally ill son which caused me a lot of worry and stress.   My GP thought that SSRI's may help and prescribed fluoxetine.   This did not help and he changed me to Cipramil which suited me better as it did not make my anxiety worse but it did not really help my anxiety that much so I stopped taking this as well.

1697,retin-a-micro,10,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,sun damage to face,"The prescription recommended that I use the gel every night, but this became too drying on my skin.  I alternate one night of Retin-A, 1 night of Stri-Vectin.  The Retin-A causes my face to peel, so exfoliating frequently is necessary so that I don't look as if my face has dandruff.  I use a Clarisonic for cleansing; it has been wonderful.  I have also used Benefit's ""Bluff Dust"" to cover the redness that the Retin-A gel causes, and continue to use Noritate for my rosacea.  The Retin-A is very effective, but also quite expensive.  I have found a pharmacy in Canada where I can order it online for less than 50% the US price.  I hope this doesn't make me sound unpatriotic!  I have always taken good care of my skin, and have no big wrinkles or droops --except for those lines between my eyebrows, because I am a committed scowler.  I do not believe that Retin-A would be as effective on skin that has already developed a good deal of sagging, but this is my personal opinion and is based only on my own experience.","Some of the information in this and the following paragraph will be redundant because when I started writing a response to the first question, I didn't see what was to follow.  The Retin-A gel dried my skin and caused it to peel.  For this reason, I used it every other day instead of every day. I alternate with Stri-Vectin.  I also need to exfoliate frequently or my face looks frightening!
When exfoliated and moisturized, my skin looks wonderful.  I have used Benefit Cosmetics' ""Bluff Puff"" to tone down the redness; I have stopped using any kind of makeup base if my face is shedding because foundation doesn't tolerate pieces of peeling skin very well.  However, my complexion looks great without makeup.  I still use mascara and liner and shadow.","Before going to bed, I wash my face with the Clarisonic brush.  I love it!
When my face is clean and dry, I apply a pea-sized amount of Retin-A gel all over my face and neck.  I do not avoid the eye area, but I do wash the gel off my eyebrows with a q-tip and water so that the skin under my eyebrows doesn't peel.  I also put Talika Lipocils on my eyelashes.  
In the morning I wash my face, exfoliating every couple of days to rid the skin surface of drying flakes.  Then I moisturize with shea butter or almond oil or even extra-virgin olive oil.  This does not make my face oily; my skin drinks up the oil and looks good.  
The following night I wash my face and when it is clean and dry, I apply Stri-Vectin.  I alternate so that one night I use Retin-A and the next night I use Stri-Vectin or another moisturizer.  I don't think I will be buying any more Stri-Vectin because I am doubtful of its effectiveness and because I would prefer to make my own product.  I know that I will be unable to make Retin-A gel, but making other products for my own use is very attractive to me."

A day after I started taking the medication, I noticed a decrease in the redness and swelling of the affected skin.

Well, I took 8 of the 10 days prescribed and not only did I never get an infection, I had few side effects.

May focus is better on this drug than all the years (about 15) I have been treated for ADD.,None as long as you don't miss any doses.  Missing more than one dose results in vertigo.  I'm sure there are very unpleasant withdrawal symptoms if you stop taking it.,"I was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder in my early 30's.  I tried different treatments...ritalin (terrible side effects), adderall (didn't work well alone), Adderall with Effexor (Worked great but is hell on your sex life) and then Adderall with Wellbutrin.  I took the Adderall with Welbutrin for 10 years but had to take ambien to sleep. Heart palpatations are another side effect of that combo.  

Menepause hit a couple of years ago and nothing seemed to work well and I developed major anxiety issues.  I started on Estrogen replacement and then asked my Dr what we could try that was closer to the Effexor I tried years ago.  That's when we tried Pristiq.  He seemed amazed at the results.  I do not need a ""drug cocktail"" anymore....I felt like Elvis for years.  I love my life again!"
72,flexeril,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,tension in jaw and bruxism (grinding of teeth),I woke up with a more relaxed jaw. I have bruxism which is the medical term for the grinding of teeth or the clenching of jaws. So if I have alot of tension in my jaw before I go to bed I will grind my teeth which will lead to migraines. Taking Cyclobenzaprine(Flexeril) before I go to bed helps me avoid waking up in pain due to Bruxism.,I have only had one side effect due to mixing Cyclobenzaprine(Flexeril) with Maxalt which lead to being fatigue and drowsiness.,"It has been only 1 week of taking Cyclobenzaprine so I may experience different side effects the more I take it. So far this medication has worked for me. I did notice one very positive benefit from taking this medication this 1 week. I started this medication around the same time I start to get PMS symptoms ""Mainly very moody and argumentative"" and I'm amazed how Cyclobenzaprine effected my PMS symptoms. I have absolutely been the most pleasant person to be around.  It feels great to be myself and not angry at everything."
3939,sular,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,high blood pressure,My blood pressure was out of control.

3701,effexor-xr,2,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,"depression, axiety","Having taken a four other drugs for depression over the last 15 years (all of the SSRI category) or so, and I can say without doubt that this drug was amazing as removing my depression, as well as substantially reducing remaining anxiety left over.","It almost immediately raised my diastolic and systolic blood pressure my 20 and 35 points respectively (up to about 105/170), as well as elevating my heart rate from 75 beats per minute to 95-100 beats. I occasionally experienced difficulty reaching orgasm in the course of sexual activity, but did not experience reduced sex drive or difficulty attaining a full erection (I'm honestly not sure whether to rate this as a side effect or a benefit).","The benefits of Effexor XR were terrific. The side effects while taking it were just fine with me, though my psychiatrist seemed alarmed about my heart rate and blood pressure. That said, the withdrawal was so atrociously horrible it simply wasn't worth taking. I would have rather taken a drug that was half as effective without this uniquely gross withdrawal. Let me put this into perspective: I've gone through nicotine, alcohol, and speed withdrawal (the last a long time ago) and the Effexor was the worst (and I required hospitalization for the alcohol). It took me between three and four months to taper off the drug. I tried to stop --unsuccessfully--at 75% the regular dose, then 50%, and then 25% before deciding to just taper it down to a dose so small I had a hard time believing it had any psychoactive effects at all. Even finally quitting taking the drug at all when I'd tapered down to 1/15th the initial dose, I experienced mild versions of the same awful withdrawal issues that had popped up before: intermittent (intense!) nausea (previously full blown vomiting on previous quitting attempts), night sweats, what I've read in Effexor forums described-inadequately-as ""brain shivers,"" though-- amusingly enough-- very little of the depression or anxiety rebound past the first few days of 0 mg. If I were at suicidal or bed-ridden level of depression this drug would be completely worth it, even with the withdrawal. Otherwise, I'm staying away from SSNRI's for a long time."

After that I began to experience itchy skin, but not enough to be bothered by it. Soon after that I then broke out in hives all over my body in the middle of the night several nights in a row.

He prescribed it on a prn basis, and i was sceptical. However, within 20 minutes of taking it, the effects were astounding. Anxiety subsided, and a feeling of warmness enveloped me.

I also believe I was thinking more clearly afterwards than I was prior to starting on lovastatin. A brain MRI taken a year after starting on Lovastatin indicated the lesions had reduced a bit, but that was not confirmed by my doctor as my previous MRI had been lost when I changed doctors.","After increasing the dosage to 20 mgs to also reduce my cholesterol levels, I started to experience extreme pain in my arm muscles.","Originally I started taking it to see if it would have any positive effect on the number and size of brain lesions I had. I had experienced an increasing inability to handle job stress, was losing my concentration abilities and was becoming increasingly forgetful. I believe it did have some positive effect in reducing the size and number of brain lesions, but not to the effect of improving my cognitive thinking ability to the extent I could return to work. Two years later, my doctor wanted me to increase the dosage to reduce my cholesterol levels.  Shortly after increasing my dosage, I started to experience chronic pain in my arms.  I finally did some research and discovered muscle pain to be a ""side effect"" when taking statin drugs.  When I stopped taking Lovastatin, the pain went away after a few months."

344,neurontin,5,Highly Effective,Severe Side Effects,"degenerative disc disorder, spinal stenosis l1-s1","Ability to sleep 8 full hours without waking up in pain was fantastic!  No need to get up during night to void, also fantastic.","Excessive daytime sleepiness, difficulty concentrating and retaining information, craving sweets which worsen my hypoglycemia, among others.","Initial 300mg was taken for only 2 days, due to severe daytime sleepiness in AM.  Found it nearly impossible to drag myself out of bed in am.  My morphine controlled release wears off within 8-9 hours, so staying in bed NOT advisable without another dose of morphine or Percocet, but the neurontin makes me want to keep sleeping.  When I finally do wake up, minimally after 11 hours after I fell asleep, I still felt tired, and now in a lot of back, hip and sometimes even knee pain, from laying in bed motionless for so long, on L side of body.  Because of the sleepiness side effect, I do not take any during day. Since my MD would not lower dosage from 300mg until next monthly visit, I bought empty size 0 gel capsules at local health food store, and painstakingly divided the dosage from the 300mg capsules into 2 150mg capsules.  Initially, this seemed to be a good solution.  I was able to continue having 8h of pain-free sleep, and getting up after 8h was easier.   But, after only 4 days at the lower 150mg dosage, the excessive sleepiness after 8h of normal sleep continued, so I need to try cutting down the dosage even more.  Have to take the dextroamphetamine controlled release, to fully wake me up in AM, and once that wore off after 12 hours in early evening, I am too tired to study for my classes.  Overall, I would recommend this drug only for adults who do not have to drive to work, or adults who can take naps during work hours, or adults who are not trying to taking classes for credit.  I am hoping the upcoming RFA procedure will allow me to stop taking the narcotics and neurontin, and allow me to be able to work, study and retain what I learn in class (especially short term memory)."

I was swollen from my breasts to my toes and attributed this to the surgery.I had told my doctor that I couldn't tolerate a high does of ibuprofen so she prescribed the generic toradol as pain relief. When the swelling showed no signs of abating, I looked up the drug's side effects and saw that swelling of the torso, thighs and legs was listed. I was trying to reduce the swelling so I stopped taking it and switched to 1 ibuprofen 4 times a day. That relieved the pain and the swelling immediately started to go down. When I told my doctor she said swelling of the torso was not a normal effect of the surgery. I conclude that the drug was at fault."

2185,clonazepam,5,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,"agoraphobia, panic disorder","Taking the rivotril made me sleepy at first but then it just calmed me down enough to be able to cope with life.  I was constantly anxious and scared and the rivotril made it possible for me to come down to relatively normal anxiety levels in ""safe"" situations, whereas before I didn't have any situations I considered safe.  It helped me sleep and made me feel more rested and in control.  I got pregnant while taking it (I had been trying for 18 years) and I honestly believe that being more relaxed helped me not only to get pregnant but to carry the baby as I had had four miscarraiges previously.  I started confronting situations that were uncomfortable to me before and was able to live a reasonably normal life, even though I have become housebound.  I feel the rivotril got me through a very tough time in my life.","The Rivotril didn't have any side effects in the long run, it made me a bit sluggish at first.  However after taking it for a few years and feeling I no longer needed it, I found it impossible to stop taking it as the withdrawal symptoms were so bad.  I have cut the dosage down considerably, from 5 mg at night to one, then I became nervous again and started taking 2 again.  I have tried several times to come off the drug completely but the results have been tremors and feeling sick along with high anxiety to the point of hardly being able to speak.  I would always go back on it.  I never felt I needed MORE...I just coudn't stop taking even a small amount.","I was told that panic attacks were caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain in the same area that caused epileptic fits.  As Rivotril is a sedative and is given to people with epilepsy they had found that it also helped alleviate panic attacks.  I was prescribed it for this reason.  I am unable to take anti-depressants which also stop panic attacks because of strong side effects so this was a better choice for me at the time.

I feel that it did the job, but had I known I would be on it for the rest of my life I'm not sure I would have started taking it.  But maybe if I was desperate like I was then I would.  I was concerned about taking it while pregnant but my child was normal.  She did have bad withdrawal symptoms though after I stopped breast feeding her.  No one realized that was what was happening when she cried all the time for seemingly no reason.  Back then it was unknown that going off the drug caused withdrawal as the drug had never been used short term.  Only for epileptics for life.  She is 13 now and perfectly normal.  However I do feel guilty about having put her through that."

to do anything fearing the pain.  I pretty much went to bed with some degree of head pain and woke up with it everyday.  I had no clue what it would be like to
live without them.  Sometime late in 1999 I went to my pharmacy to pick us some
prescritions, that were not working anyway, and one of the tech who suffered
headaches constantly was smiling and seemed so different.  Her eyes were wide
open,  she seemed happy, etc.  She told me her Doctor had put her on Elavil

physician and asked for Elavil. Two weeks later I started going whole days
without head pain.  I went to sleep easily and slept till morning.  I looked
forward to doing things.  I woke up without pain.  What a miracle!  I have
probably had only two or three actual migraines in the last eight years.  When
I do get a slight headache it usually disappears within a short time without
additional meds.  Needless to say my entire life changed. I am a better wife, mother, daughter, friend.  I take the generic and notice no difference from

The only negative effects were sometimes having to reach to find the word I was trying to use (which has since lessened, although it still happens occasionally) and pretty bad acne (which I am now treating separately and is much better.) Neither of those effects are on the PI sheet, and my doctor seems very skeptical that either was caused by the drug, but I've found lots of anecdotal evidence of other people experiencing similar things.

I was also very agitated and angry, lashing out at loved ones for seemingly no reason. Lamotrigine started lifting the depression almost immediately, and once I hit the theraputic dose of 200 mg, it was like a cloud lifted overnight. I still have some ups and downs, but nothing major, and even when destructive thoughts cross my mind, I'm able to push them away more easily.

As far as my side effects goes I feel great. Almost a natural ""high"" if you will. I am very talkative and focused. I will say that I do not have much of an appetite. My stomach feels fine and the lower pain has gone away for the most part. I do realize I am taking more pills now because the effectivness has worn off a bit, doing my research on this I have heard that being the case many times.","Overall I am going to a OBGYN specialist next week and they are going to  determine what is the exact problem. As urgent care and the hospitalcould not figure it out, which scares me truthfully. Hopefully I will not have to take anything and the pain will go away.

I have been on it for two months and am still improving.,During the second week I experienced stomach problems.  I had diarrhea that lasted for about a week.  I also had moderate headaches which lasted a little longer than the stomach issues.,"I went to the doctor due to problems associated with my depression.  I had been taking Wellbutrin but it seemed to be losing its effect.  The doctor recommended adding another antidepressant to boost the Wellbutrin.  I attempted three other anti-depressants but had severe side effects. Zoloft, Lexapro, and Celexa all caused me to have severe diarrhea.  During the four weeks that I stayed with Zoloft I experienced little improvement and lost 15 pounds as a result of the diarrhea and lack of appetite."
43,zyprexa,1,Ineffective,Moderate Side Effects,bipolar disorder type ii,"While taking Zyprexa, I never experienced any episodes of hypomania (low mania) which typically accompany Bipolar Type II; however, I attribute this mostly to the fact that Zyprexa is very sedating. It should be noted that although Zyprexa is classified as an A-typical antipsychotic, it is also used as a mood stabilizer in patients with Bipolar Disorder.","Increased appetite which of course lead to weight gain which caused me to feel depressed!  I am not exaggerating when I say my appetite was almost insatiable. Excessive sleepiness during the day which caused me to actually start falling asleep while talking to someone on several occassions.  It also made me feel almost ""numb"" emotionally.  Sedation along with an insatiable appetite caused me to gain over 25 pounds.","My psychiatrist prescribed Zyprexa to help with the mood swings of Bipolar Disorder.  I am classified as Bipolar Type II because I do not experience the extreme highs of mania (manic episodes) that accompany Bipolar Type I.  I do, however, experience hypomania (hypo meaning low) so my moods still swing from highs to the extreme lows of depression."

2178,frova,8,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,migraine headache,Frova eliminated Migraine Headaches and the effect would last 24 hours.,"The effect was slow.  Approximately one or two hours before any significant pain relief was noticed.  Also, some nausea from the drug.",As soon as a migraine was detected a Frova would be administered.  If the migraine was intercepted immediately the Frova was succesful with relieving pain and the chance of a rebound headache was slim.  If a frova was not administered immediately a maxalt was taken then two hours afterwards a frova.  This would eliminate pain for twenty four to thirty hours. On occasion a rebound headache would occur.

I am always tired even though I am finally sleeping most of the night, I have developed the bumps on the forhead that everyone talks about, and I have the need to constantly unrinate. I have been reading reviews online now for a week and am getting concerned because most comments show that people find the side effects worse than the condition and I have just started. I believe that I am also suffering from depression, but because I am a single parent I try to keep myself busy with family issues which allows me to put aside the bad feelings temporarily.","Have done 3 infusions, starting with 2 weeks after first and then 4 weeks. Now I am awaiting my 4th which will be 8 weeks. The staff have been great, from the nurse who does the procedure to the councillor at Bio-Advance, but the one draw back is that I have been telling both the nurse and the councillor about my side effects and they acted so surprised. So why did I find out by going online myself that these side effects are common?"
534,trazodone,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,insomnia,"Trazodone allows me to fall asleep within ten minutes and sleep through the night, awaking in the morning without grogginess.","I have noticed no side effects. I have never needed to increase my dosage over the course of five years, and when I skip a dose, my insomnia is exactly what it was before taking trazodone, no worse.","50 mg taken with water directly before bed puts me to sleep within ten minutes or so. I wake up 7-8 hours later (unless forced to get up earlier by my alarm clock) without feeling drugged or groggy. The insomnia being treated was the kind where I was able to fall asleep after about a half hour in bed, but then I would wake up again after a couple of hours and be unable to fall back asleep. This mild, nonaddictive drug has successfully addressed the insomnia that has affected me since childhood."

I also have tried other prescriptions for acid reflux and none have worked for me as well as Prevacid has.,"I have found that if I take it too early prior to going to bed, it's less effective. Also, there have been a few times (very few) where it hasn't worked and I have gotten acid reflux (ash taste in mouth, vomiting, pain in throat and chest)  Also, for whatever reason, there also have been times I have had to take 2 pills versus the usual 1 pill.",One pill once a day.

267,ultram,9,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,tempromandibular joint dysfunction (tmj),Taking Tramadol has resulted in the effective management of chronic pain due to severe TMJ.,"The side effects of taking Tramadol for 11 years is addiction.  If I miss a dose, I experience typical withdrawal symptoms (e.g., nausea, headache, restless leg syndrome, stomach cramps).","Tramadol was prescribed after suffering from TMJ for over 20 years. I suffered from chronic pain due to severe TMJ complications.  In addition, the TMJ was causing migraine headaches and insomnia.  After all conventional methods of treatment (e.g., exercises, mouth appliances etc.) and drugs (e.g, ibuprofen) did not alleviate the problem, symptoms or pain, the only option left was surgery.  Because surgery for TMJ conditions is not a guarantee for success, I was reluctant to agree to the procedure.  Finally, as a last resort, I met with a doctor who specialized in chronic pain management and I was prescribed Tramadol, 100 mg/twice daily.  This drug has worked extremely well for the past 11 years in controlling the pain."

4036,tri-luma,5,Marginally Effective,Mild Side Effects,hyperpigmentation,Mild lightening of age and sun spots.,Slight dryness at the beginning of treatment. Increased sun sensitivity.,"Started using the cream every other night and increased it to every night. It somewhat lightened my freckles and age spots pretty quickly (within a couple of weeks) but after that stopped helping. I also had a brown patchy area on my leg that has been around forever. I used it as my ""test"" patch to monitor progress. Just like my face it lightened the spot pretty quickly and then stopped working. The spot since then has remained lighter but has never gone away altogether. 
I would say I saw a 25% improvement in the sun spots on my face.  I have a lot of them so overall it didn't really make a difference in how my skin looks. 
I did not have much irritation when I started using this product but I had been using Retin A before I started the Tri Luma so maybe my skin was used to it already. I did notice that it stung the skin around my eyes when I used it on the brown spots high up on my cheekbones.
Also, was told it would help reduce acne and breakouts.  It did not which is disappointing. 
I use 50+ sunscreen every day and stay out of direct sunlight."

I believe that the slow increase of the dosage helped control any negative side effects.  It took about 3 months to really start noticing a difference, but that could be due to the titrating schedule.  I am also trying to be more conscious of what I do eat and when, which is helping with the weight loss and appetite issues."
287,panixine-disperdose,9,Moderately Effective,Moderate Side Effects,sinus infection,"The treatment benefits were that the cephalexin relieved the sinus infection around the 4th day and by the seventh day my sinuses felt better. The cephalexin seemed relatively mild as I did not experience any intestinal discomfort, bloating or cramping that I have experienced with other antibiotics.",I developed vaginitis and a yeast infection. This usually starts to occur around four or five days after I finish a round of antibiotics. This reaction to antibiotics first started to occur around ten years ago after I was treated with tetracycline for six months for a severe case of lyme's disease.,I had a sinus infection and was instructed to take 500mg. of cephalexin every 6 hours for seven days. It took four days before the cephalexin took effect. I have a hard time getting an antibiotic that I don't have a negative reacton to. I am allergic to penecilan and can't take Z-pack because it severely upsets my intestinal tract.

Occasional dizziness when the INR counts went above 3 or 4. It's difficult at times to get a stable INR reading due to all the various foods, supplements, and drugs which either increase or decrease Coumadin's effects.","Prescribed Coumadin after DVT and PE stay (with IV heparin first) for six months.

Because of this, I ended up having my tonsils and adenoids removed separately but this did not help at all. I also relieved several treatments for antibiotics but this was wasted as all they did was lowered my immune system. After being diagnosed with an airborne allergy, I took one tablet daily, they worked on the first day and completely helped.","The drowsiness was overwhelming, I was sleeping for about 16hours a day with no relief after and my appetite increased rapidly. I was consuming about three times my usual intake.","Overall, they worked but the side affects were incredibly bad."

Therefore there was little of no chance of irritation of the esophagus.,Constipation and even less chance of digesting food properly.,"Even though the reflux was kept under control I felt that constipation and poor digestion was a bad trade-off.  As there is bowel cancer in the family clearing of the large intestine is important to me.  I have now stopped taking the drug and prefer to treat the reflux by taking care of what I eat, how and when I eat, and being careful not to bend over too much after food.

279,xyrem,9,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,narcolepsy,"Xyrem has been life-changing for me and more than I could have ever hoped for.  I spent most of my life completely exhausted and desperately tired.  The worst part was, I always just thought I was lazy.  Even after I was diagnosed, and was on Provigil (I was taking Provigil only for years before Xyrem)I still questioned if I really had a sleep disorder and thought that perhaps I was just lazier than everyone else.  Now that I take Xyrem, I know that I really do have a sleep disorder because Xyrem has changed my life so much.  I could have never imagined how much better and easier life is with a good nights sleep.  Without Xyrem, I spend most too much time in REM sleep.  I would dream constantly, beginning almost immediately after I would fall asleep.  Almost every morning I would wake up and still be in a dream.  Xyrem forces me into NREM sleep and it has made all the difference for me.","Im sure it causes night sweats and significant weight loss.  Other side effects that may or may not be related that I experience (although I also started taking it after the birth of my first child and may be related to that rather than the Xyrem)were receeding hairline, short term memory impact, some decrease in cognitive function such as difficulty with word recall, following a more complex line of reasoning, etc.., and increased anxiety.  Even given the side effects, my life is so much better now that I am not so exhausted and I can't imagine going back to life before Xyrem.",1 dose right before bed and another 3-4 hours later.

After about 4 days the rash was spreading and so I went back and received oral Lamisil. I took that for 14 days and the rash was lighter but still there. The doctor then prescribed Ketoconazole and after 3 days the rash was significantly lighter. By the end of the prescription the rash was almost completely gone.

2543,cosopt,9,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,high interoccular pressure,Cosopt reduced my occular pressure in both eyes by nearly one third which pleased my eye doctor. The treatment benefits are long term. Reducing occular pressure will prolong eyesight by preserving the optical nerves. Sorry not 50 words.,"I suspect it caused increased hair loss (thining) which I became aware of after about two - two and a half years of using the medication. I had hair loss before ever starting medications but it seems like this medicine began increasing the problem. Cosopt burned initially on application and turned the eyes red which cleared up fairly quickly. I am not aware of any other side effect. I switched medications and further explanation is below. If I knew these drugs do cause hair loss it might affect its rating,... but then again it does save the eyes.",I had elevated occular pressure that needed to be reduced and my doctor put me on xalatan which caused my eyelashes to begin to thicken and become dark in a couple of months so I had him put me on something else so we went to cosopt. After a time I felt like this was causing increased hair loss so I looked up drug side effects and cosopt was listed as causing hair loss so I had him change it again then I started alphagan p and azopt. My eyes after nearly two months time turned red and never cleared up so the doctor dropped the alphagan p and replaced it with timilol 0.25 percent. The redness quickly went away. Now with azopt in each eye once in the morning and once at bedtime and timilol 0.25 in both in the mornings only my occular pressures have been reduced one to two points lower in each eye than what the cosopt did when taken in the morning and at bedtime. These changes have not stopped the hair loss from occuring even though timilol 0.25 percent has half the timilol in it as the cosopt and is used only once a day in each eye vs cosopts twice a day in each eye. Azopt is reported to cause hair loss and is very similar to the second ingredient in cosopt.

Sometimes i had to lay off of it for a few weeks to regain my strength. This stuff has some serious side effects. Men feel the side effects much worse then woman do.,make sure your doctor prescribes you 800 mg because its wayy cheaper because you can cut them in half if you want because they are tablets. Its like the same price as the 200 mg for the same count so its really stupid to get the lower dose when you can just cut up the higher dose.

Within 6-8 weeks of beginning Leflunomide (and still continuing Orencia), symptoms began to decrease significantly, and my lab values improved dramatically. As I write this I have very little pain and inflammation, and much more mobility than before - even considering the joint damage I've sustained. Recently, I tried reducing my dose of Leflunomide to 10 mg/day. After 4-6 weeks or so, I began to have more symptoms. When I resumed the 20mg/day dose, symptoms decreased dramatically again - in about 6-8 weeks.","I have some GI distress, but am not sure if it's directly due to Leflunomide or to a long history of taking RA medications which also negative have GI effects.

I had a very serious eye infection last year which resulted in corneal scarring and loss of much vision in one eye.

After reaching 400mg a day- I went from having 3-4 generalized seizures A WEEK, to 3 TOTAL in many many years! Unfortunately, I continued having partial complex seizures until we found the Dilantin/Lamictal/Topamax combo (in the last 3 years) and I still have 1 or 2 of those a month.  I really owe my life to topamax. AWESOME drug. Awesome awesome awesome.","In the beginning I remember getting ""topatingles"" or tingling in my fingers (that hurt sometimes), toes, and even my lips. I lost a lot of weight and have stayed in the underweight category ever since. My memory vanished (I affectionately nicknamed this drug ""stupimax"" and ""Dopamax""), I got strange aches and pains in my bones, joints, and muscles. I was more sensitive to the sun and heat and my sweat was reduced. I frequently had a runny nose and cough. Food tasted funny. Sex felt different (not bad- just different) my skin was  very sensitive to touch and my hearing was overactive. My potassium kept testing deficient and I had to be prescribed supplements. My hair also fell out in clumps!

All that went away or got better with some time. I also found out WHY it was happening- I was malnourished. Once I started drinking 56-80oz of water a day, taking a multivitamin + biotin (for the hair issue!), eating potassium rich foods and a more healthy diet all of a sudden the side effects started to vanish.

Over the past 4 years my HDL levels have been significantly higher, and my overall cholesterol has moved into the acceptable zone (though not as good as I wish it was)!","Niaspan is a high dose of Niacin (vitamin B) and causes a good amount of flushing at a dose of 1000mg.  My cholesterol levels were screwy, and I had a more holistic doctor at the time.  She wanted to avoid drugs that she considered more harsh.  I was instructed to take the dose right before I went to bed.  I took the first dose about an hour before bed, and I turned beet red with the most amazing full-body flush.  Skin on my arms, torso, chest, neck and face was flushed.  I was really hot and really uncomfortable.  I went to lay down and try to sleep, but I couldn't get comfortable.  It was embarrassing because we had a guest staying with us at the time!  After about 15-20 minutes the flush subsided, and I was able to fall asleep.  So it is important to literally take the pill as you're getting into bed.  I've noticed some flushing sort of subconsciously while I'm asleep, but it generally doesn't wake me up.","I started with 1000mg and stayed at that level for about 2 years.  Then, after I moved and changed doctors, my dose was reduced to 500mg/night.

When I first began taking the medication, I slept ALL the time--as much as 22 hours a day.  I literally could not stay awake.  This may have been due not only to the drug's sedating affect, but to the vast sleep deficit of that years of pain and insomnia had produced.  As time went on, I slept less, and was less dependent on the Baclofen as a ""maintenance"" medication--I began to ""save"" it to take in slightly more concentrated doses when a severe muscle spasm or strain, or a ""flare"" occurs, which happens frequently in fibromyalgia patients.  I have noticed that the drug is less effective than it used to be, requiring higher doses to treat the same level of stiffness or cramping."

I like to consider it in the same way I did Avonex for all those years; it sucks, but it keeps me on my toes and therefore worth it.","Very simple once you establish a simple routine.  ""Shared Solutions"", the company behind Copaxone provides you with everything you need for each injection, including; in home injection training, which I was able to get down with just one session, but they will come as often as you need.

You load an injection tool with a syringe.  Remove the cap from the syringe (simple).  Wipe the inection site with a kind of cheap, provided alcohol wipe.  Let the alcohol dry (30-60) seconds.  Place the tip of the tool on the injection site, press a button and the tool injects the shot in about 7-15 seconds.  It varies.  Yeah, I called them cheap alcohol wipes, but they are good enough and I'm picky.  I buy my own because they are inexpensive.

I used the freezing technique, but warts were clearly trying to spread outside the treated area onto fresh skin areas..  I then added the salicylic acid to the new growths but this just made my arm/skin sore.  I could see the only solution was to control the virus itself to prevent any new spread as the thickened areas died off with the cryotherapy. 
I used a thin smear of Acyclovir around the treated areas and all the new wart 'blistering' stoped iritating within an hour or so and died back.  If I left the cream off - they would start again.  I persisted with the cream daily for 2 weeks and for the first time in 10 years or more my arm is 'wart free' and I have healthy unbroken wart free skin.","None - In fact it gave great relief to sore irritated skin as new 'wart' blister tried to form. 

I suggest a clinical trial to be used in conjunction with cryotherapy to prevent spread and regrowth - once warts are treated.

I was put on the generic version of this pill at somepoint and I had a completely different reaction.  I instantly gained about 15 pounds (mostly water weight I think because I looked puffy).

The doctors there suspected either cardiac problems or a blood clot in the lungs. Once they made certain there were no blood clots, and that the EKG and cardiac enzyme levels were normal, they started me on IV protonix. The next day I was switched to pill form of the protonix, and the improvement was amazing. Within thirty-six hours the pain was minimal, and by the third day of treatment, it was virtually gone. Since then, I haven't had any recurrence, and remain on the protonix only because of the ulcer, which is improving, even though at a slower pace.

2065,warfarin,6,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,heart condition,"Taking 3 mg of warfarin sufficiently thinned my blood so that I did not find it difficult to do everyday tasks.  I immediately felt better after I started the regimen in the spring of 2003.  My cough went away and I had a lot more energy.
I took this regimen for about 3 years, everyday.  I also found it easier to concentrate and think (what was I doing before it???)  It was as if my brain cleared up or something.  I breathed easier and I was more willing to tackle regular household chores.  I worked over 50 hours/week before and during this treatment.","The side effects of warfarin on me did not become apparent until a couple of years later.  I started feeling weak and I bruised easily.  I acquired more broken blood vessels/capillaries veins in my feet and calves.  I was tired and started feeling cranky.  I stopped taking warfarin for 6 months but then went back to it after I had the old feeling of ""thick"" blood.  During the 6 months that I wasn't taking warfarin, I felt better, had more energy.  But then the downside: my blood was getting too thick and I was starting to get headaches.  So I went back on it.  This time my doctor said I might have to increase dosage to 4 mg. since I hadn't been taking the warfarin.  However, when I had my thrombin checked, I was okay at 3 mg.; I took this for another 3 months and then started feeling the old way and quit again.  The same scenario was repeated (started feeling like I had ""thick"" blood and now I had increasingly bad headaches).  I went back on 3 mg. of warfarin in August of this year but only took them for 3 months. Then I started a vitamin/mineral/COQ10 regimen and stuck with it and am still doing that.  I credit most of the perfect blood feeling (for lack of a better term) to Vitamin E and the fact that I also changed my diet.  I try to eat a lot of veggies and fruits, and I have been a vegetarian for almost two years (not super strict - but I feel disgusted about eating meat and therefore never eat it unless it is buried in some food.  I do eat salmon and tuna.  The final straw for me with warfarin was that I started feeling really mad about things.  The littlest things would make me angry, anger that was way out of proportion to the incident.   When my teenaged daughter started crying after I ripped into her for staying longer at a social visit, and I heard my words echoing in my house, I knew that was it.  I quit warfarin and started taking 81 mg. of aspirin daily (I had a headache every morning after I went off warfarin).  I started the vit./min. regimen in November, gradually adding supplements as I learned about their benefits, but it wasn't until 3-4 weeks ago that I realized I wasn't having any headaches and I was able to stop taking 81 mg. of aspirin. Also, since starting the stricter diet and the vit./min. supplements (also some herbs), I have not had an anger ""fit"" (of course, I am also more prone to control my anger because I really didn't like how I had been), I do not feel depressed.  I have told everyone in my family about this because it seems so remarkable.  Why didn't the doctors tell me?","Treatment consisted of simply taking 3 mg. of warfarin daily and getting my blood thrombin checked every two months.  I was not a very good patient about getting my blood thr. checked so I'm sure when I was feeling weak and bruised/bled so easily, my blood was getting too thin.  And then when I would quit the warfarin for several weeks, sometimes months at a time, my blood would get too thick.  I really like my doctor though, because he tells me to do what makes me feel best, and I think that's smart advice.  I must say add that I always loved the feeling of donating blood before I took warfarin because it gave me the same feeling as I initially had with warfarin (at the very beginning of my treatment).  I would like to donate blood now but they don't let me because I don't weigh enough (which makes no sense at all).  Couldn't they take less blood?  Who determined how much blood you can give anyway?"

I had successfully used Luvox and was able to discontinue it without any side effects or symptoms of worry returning.  This time only the generic was available to me so I tried it - thinking that it would be the same drug and provide similar results.  It did not.  I experienced nausea, and did not get any sleep benefits, although I felt that the Luvox had improved my sleep when taken at night; neither version of the drug caused any drowsiness.  I did not feel any improvement in symptoms with the generic version.  Perhaps my hormones needed to balance on their own, and were too intense for the fluvoxamine to modify.  I hope there will be something better available if menopause eventually causes a return of symptoms.

I HIGHLY SUGGEST TO AVOID THAT.","I initially started at 4mg (/half 8mg tablet) 1x in am.  Gradually rose to 1 8mg tablet 1x in am, and then 2 8mg tablets 1x in am.

I actually felt better after taking my pill, I was more bubbly and felt like my old self. I was also less aggravated and could think more clearly.",I did not have any bad side effects. The only bad thing I can say about Prestiq is it is expensive about $50 a month even with insurance. There is no generic as of yet.,I would take one pill before bed time each day.

Before I was given these by my doctor my migrains lasted for 3 days with severe headache and nausea.,"My doctor told me to take one as you feel a migraine coming on, if it does not work it is not worth taking another one but this rarely happens. If the headache goes but comes back I can take another one, I tend to do this if the attack is servere, I might need to take two or even three over two or three days but generally I find one tablets works.

The treatment dramatically lessened the effect of nicotine withdrawal, or at least its perception, such that any reflexive craving to smoke was manageably overcome until the habit was finally broken.","At 150mg/d side effects were minimal - perhaps a slight boost in energy. In contrast, at 300mg/d - which I could handle for only a short period - I felt ""shaky"" with restless legs and some insomnia. These problems went away when I reverted to 150mg/d. I feel the treatment was entirely effective at this lower dose, and unmanageably unpleasant at the higher [and recommended!] dose. Perhaps Zyban should revisit their dosing recommendations.","I began taking 150mg/d two weeks/ 14 days before my actual quit date. On the quit date, I also started a series of yoga classes and regular physical activity through the first few months of smoking cessation. I decided to continue taking Zyban beyond the recommended period to a full 3 months at 1 dose daily. In my experience, I would recommend a lower daily dosage of 150mg/d for a longer extended period of time given my success in using Zyban in this manner."

I have also prescribed it for neuropathic patient. Most patients experience no benefit, or if there is any benefit, it occurs at small doses.

During the last month and a half I was having issues with my menstrual cycle. I had four periods during that time. My usual cycle is typically somewhere between 35 and 45 days. So this worried me a little. By the end of the third month I was experiencing mood swings. Caused by my irregular menstrual cycle? Possibly. I don't know for sure. I would wake up mad, have a wonderful day, and then come home and cry myself to sleep. And why would I be so upset? No freaking clue, but I do know that it was entirely exhausting.

When I first started using this product, they gave me a weaker strength and I gradually was given stronger formulas as my skin got used to it.  The only problem was that if I used a little too much, even later as my skin was used to the formula, I would wake up with red skin that looked like a sunburn.

1685,claritin,9,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,indoor allergies,"I recently saw my PCP for my annual exam and had 2 major concerns to discuss with her.  The first was some depression issues and the second was that I had recently developed indoor allergies.  As is standard my PCP recommended antidepressants and therapy for the depression and Claritin (24hr non-drowsy) for the allergies.  The problem is that I am nursing my son and no antidepressants are ""safe"" for nursing mothers (or rather, for our nursing children).  On the other hand, my MD approved Claritin although I was nursing.  At the end of the session she told to to start on Claritin and come back for the antidepressants once I weened my son.  So I started the Claritin and my depression abated.  All of my ""depressive"" symptoms were relieved (the inability to sleep at night but feelings of tiredness all day, the aches, the inability to concentrate...).  Since I started taking Claritin it was like a switch was flipped and the quality of my life has increased significantly.  I feel ""normal"" for the first time in a long time.  In terms of my allergies, the sneezing, runny nose and watery eyes have lessened but my red eye concern (the swelling and redness of the area surrounding my eyes) has not been relieved.  Regardless, I am happy with the product.

I share this in the hope that some scientist out there uses this information to help our elusive understanding of depression and its treatment.  Perhaps an alternative for postpartum depression?  Many mother's feel guilty weening shortly after birth in order to treat their sadness and if Claritin is approved by your MD for use while nursing, why not try it?  Or even as an alternative to conventional depression meds.",It ended my year long depression.,Please see above.

I didnt realize the cough could be a side effect from the drug, but as soon as I replaced it with Benicar, the symptons disappeared.",I took the drug once daily in the morning and outwardly I felt no discomfort at all.

I used to sleep 12-16 hours per day and was always tired and fatigued when awake.  I was diagnosed with sleep apnea 5 years ago, but even sleeping with CPAP did not help with my daytime fatigue.  After seeing MANY family practitioners, I finally broke down and INVESTED in a very well educated Psychiatrist who diagnoed me with ADD since childhood.  His decision to prescribe Vyvanse was brilliant!  I feel better than ever and am totally clear headed and able to consentrate.  For the first time in as long as I can remember, I can think normally!  No more racing thoughts in my head, and my depression and anxiety has all but vanashed!  I do still take an antidepressive, but I am CERTAIN that the Vyvanse gave the antidepression meds the ability to work.  I can FINALLY sleep a normal 7 to 9 hours and still be awake and alert throughout my 12-hour work days.  I was worried that the Vyvanse would elevate my anxiety level, but the opposite occured!  My anxiety is all but absent, and I no longer have the need to continue with my anti-anxiety meds!  There is NO SUBSTITUTE for a Doctor who is a specialist in mental health.  Spend the money and see!  A good Psychiatrist will spend HOURS with you before making a diagnosis, and if Adult ADD is what you have, then give Vyvanse a try.  It worked GREAT for me and my live has turned around for the better.  It is the best remedy that I have found in 15 years!  You MUST take it when you awaken for your day, because it takes about 12-15 hours to get out of your system.  If you take it later in the day - you will experaince insomnia.

Even within 3 months it greatly reduced the pain associated with the disease and decreased the number of times I had to use the bathroom from  40 per day to <20 per day. With continued use, I believe it helped reduce inflammation/mast cell production in my bladder, and along with dietary changes and treatment for infections to my bladder wall lining caused by Lyme disease related organisms, Elmiron allowed my bladder to heal to some degree, reducing my symptoms further and my incidence of urinating to <10 times per day on average."

This increases the blood flow close to the skin and releases histamines. The resulting hot flush and itching lasts for about 15 minutes.

The newer antidepressants, particularly Prozac and Effexor, were lifesavers for me and I expect to be on a daily antidepressant for life.  Antidepressants such as Prozac and Lexapro, however, greatly depressed my sexual desire and ability to reach climax (adversely affecting my relationship with my husband).

The product does not work over face parenthesis or deep wrinkles.  It appeared to me that skin's tone also improved.  The skin also developed a healthy shine.",The side effects as reported are skin redness and sun sensitivity.  I experienced both.  Always use this product with a sun screen or you will burn 10X faster. The product should be used as directed and a little goes a long ways.

3061,oxycodone,3,Moderately Effective,Severe Side Effects,pain management,"Initially the treatment benefits were
-increased mobility/ activity level due to experiencing less pain
- sleep ( was able to sleep longer while the medication was still active)
- better mood (because of less pain)","The level of pain control quickly decreased (with the prescribed amount of medication(10 mg)) resulting in having to steadily increase the dosage for the same amount of pain relief. However the worst side effects were severe constipation(even while taking stool softeners/extra fiber, water, etc), depression, insomnia, weight loss, hair loss, muscle wasting, my skin became completely dehydrated and wrinkled. Became physically and mentally addicted to the medication, when I tried to reduce the dosage /stop taking the medication I experienced severe withdrawal symptoms (fever,chills, nausea, vomiting, severe bone muscle and joint pain) to name a few.","I was in an MVA in 2002 in which I suffered a whiplash type injury which caused/accelerated the DDD. I was prescribed Percocette 5mg on an as needed basis for pain control. After 3 years (of constant agonizing pain)of being on the Percocette they became ineffective at relieving pain and I was referred to a PAIN CLINIC specializing in chronic pain. The doctors there decided that I had built up a tolerance/dependence on the Percocette and that it would be best to put me on a longer acting narcotic (Oxycontin 10mg,time released, supposed to provide pain relief for 12 hrs) with Percocette (Oxycodone 5mg/Acetaminophen 325 mg)for break through pain. In the beginning the medication seemed to help but over time I built up a tolerance to the Oxycodone(they became less effective) which meant I had to keep increasing the dosage to get the same amount of pain relief. For example I started out with Oxycontin 10mg/3x day and approx 3 Percocette/daily a couple of months later as my tolerance increased I had to take Oxycontin 20mg/3X day and 5-6 Percocette as the months passed by my tolerance grew and my dosage was increased. After about 8 months on the Oxycontin I started to experience all of the side effects mentioned above, not only did I notice the negative effects the drug was having on me but friends and family noticed too, and mentioned (not to me but amongst themselves) that my appearance/demeanor over the past 2 yrs had dramatically changed. A couple of months ago my Sister took me aside and asked me what was wrong to which I replied nothing why? She then explained to me how my behavior(depression, moodiness, etc.) and appearance(drastic weight loss) had been getting worse and worse and told me that she was worried. Being under the influence of these drugs for so long I felt like I was in a fog and really had no idea as to the extent of how bad it really was/ how I looked. So I stepped back and examined the last 4-5 yrs of my life while on these medications and realized that they had taken a considerable toll on me emotionally, physically, mentally. I strongly advise that before anyone decides to go this route for pain management that you have a long talk with your Physician on the pros and cons of this medication specifically the Oxycontin. If I would have known then what I know now about all the negative side effects I would never, never had started taking it. I feel that it deteriorated my body (especially my muscle mass and skin). When I started taking the medication I was 37 and felt 25 and was told I looked like I was in my late 20's, I am now 42, I feel 50 and now in an effort to spare my feelings people don't mention anything about how old I look . I wish that my Physicians would have told me about ALL of the negative effects of this medication instead of just the positive (which are few). In my opinion the negative far outweigh the positive. I'm still in constant pain but will continue to search for pain management without drugs. PLEASE USE WITH CAUTION!"

I suspect that these drugs were also contributing to the blood sugar issues and low throid.,"I chose to discontinue the HRT completely after I developed a painful mastitis in my lt breast, and 6months later a mamogram showed a suspicious spot that was removed and biopsied.

1620,premarin,1,Moderately Effective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,hot flashes / night sweats,"The Premarin did reduce the frequency and severity of hot flashes and night sweats.  From that perspective, the drug was somewhat effective.  However, the side effects were devastating and worse than dealing with the menopausal symptoms.  It took me two years to discern that the problems I encountered were attributable directly to the Premarin.","I developed strange lesions on my arms, which were sore and very embarrassing.  I could not wear short-sleeved shirts, because of the mess my arms had become.  Obviously, I showed them to the doctor; he simply shrugged his shoulders and said he didn't have a clue what might be causing the lesions.  When I went off the Premarin, on my own volition, the lesions disappeared to a significant degree.  When I added proteolytic enzymes and hydrochloric acid to my diet, the lesions disappeared completely.  I am now able to use bioidentical hormone replacement therapy with complete success and no side effects whatsoever.","The doctor put me on the maximum dosage because I was ""young"" for menopause.  Did not test estrogen levels either before beginning treatment or after starting the HRT.  I simply took one Premarin pill per day, every day."
857,valium,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,"anxiety, panic disorder",I was given valium to calm me down as I couldn't take anti depressants as they gave me really severe side effects.  I found that the valium quietened my mind and slowed my body down without making me feel heavy or drugged.  It helped me cope with the stresses of every day life but also the stresses caused by my anxiety and panic disorder.  I think that is has a bad reputation possibly because people abuse it but taken as prescribed I find this drug incredibly useful and invaluable in helping me cope with things I wouldn't normally be able to do or cope with.  I get a warm feeling as it goes into my blood all the way down to my toes. I feel relaxed and happy and don't have any side effects whatsoever.  However it does make me feel a little sleepy for about half an hour after it starts working...which is actually a nice feeling when you're nervous and then I just feel relaxed.,"I didn't have any side effects at all.  But it does make me sleepy for a little while in higher doses when it first starts working (YES, I can actually feel when it starts)","I started having panic attacks in different places until my world became very restricted.  A doctor prescribed Valium and it helped.  I have still got worse over the years but valium still helps me cope with things like that I wouldn't normally be able to do at all, like shopping, going to the dentist, or out in public.  I feel valium has had a very bad write up...mainly I feel through abuse.  I've taken it most of my life and never took more than I was told to.  In fact I was so afraid it would ""stop"" working that I only took it when absolutely necessary.  This means that although I have taken it most of my life in larger or smaller doses, it still works for me and gets me though the hard times.  I don't think I have ever tried a drug that has helped me cope as well as this one has.  I hope it never gets taken off the market.  I currently take half a 5 mg tab when I have to do something I consider difficult, only taking the other half after assessing if one half is enough.  I hardly ever take more than one in a day and hardly ever more than two tabs in a week....sometimes a month.  Depending on my commitments."

911,paxil,7,Highly Effective,Severe Side Effects,"depression, social anxiety disorder","For the first two weeks I did not feel absolutely anything. Then, after about 15 days, I began to feel different. My constant sense of fear and worry was replaced by a sudden feeling of self-confidence. My depression, which formerly kept me in a state of perpetual sorrow, self-pity and doubt, was lifted from me like a veil. Suddenly I was talkative and social, where before I was soft-spoken and hesitant. I behaved as if I could not fail in anything I undertook to do. I was asking women on dates with a directness and boldness that almost scared women away. You could say that while I was taking Paxil I was in a hypermanic state. The benefits were very real. I loved the miraculous effects of this medication. Unfortunately I was forced to stop taking Paxil because of negative side effects.","Decreased libido, insomnia, dry mouth, increased appetite","I was not able to have sex because Paxil left me sexually numb. It was difficult to maintain an erection. When I did get an erection it was without any sexual pleasure, in other words, it was just a mechanical erection.
I could not sleep no matter how tired I became during the day. I had constant energy that would not go away even when I wanted to sleep. The insomnia was so bad that even sleeping pills could not counteract Paxil.
Dry mouth was mild to moderate, but nonetheless bothersome.
I gained a tremendous amount of weight in a short time. I went from 171lbs. to 227lbs. in about 4 months. Paxil gave me a huge appetite. I simply could not stop thinking about food, particularly sweets."

627,nortriptyline,7,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,shooting nerve-type pain in legs/fibromyalgia,"the excruciating, shooting nerve pain in my left leg stopped after about a week although I could still feel that the nortriptyline just masked the pain ie. In the past 6 months I have got down to 12.5 mg per day although a recurrence of the terrible shooting pain (after 2 years) had made me decide to try Gabapentin instead- my doc recommends this","Fuzziness of thinking/short term memory loss- although this might be due to my fibromyalgia. Sexual disfunction- ie inability to have a full orgasm- and after 2 years of this, thi sis one of the reasons why I am ready to change to Gabapentin- as recommended by my doc. Sleepiness etc goes away after the first few weeks although it took me a good 6 months to properly adapt to this drug","10mg at night for the first 6 months, then the pain came through again so I upped this to 25mg per day. Six months ago, I wasn;t aware of any pain behind the pain that I had been used to so, thinking I was maybe a bit better, I cut the intake down to 12.5 mg a day by cutting my 25mg tablet in half each night. this was fine until a week ago when the shocking shooting pain returned accompanied by pin-prick sensations on my face and on my limbs- I've not had thi sin 2 years. I intend to try gabapentin now, although some people have referred to it as the 'zombie drug'. My main reason for not upping the Nortrip back to 25mg, is that I want to see if I will be able to have an orgasm on the Gaba- although maybe this is a luxury- as anyone with nerve pain knows, sex is the last thing on your mind when you are in such pain.

I know this type of drug can cause sexual side effects and weight gain, but I have had no issues here. The only thing I noticed was the very first week I took it I was a bit sleepy/groggy during the day, but this went away once I adjusted.","Started out with a very low dose, 5mg/day for the first month, then moved up to 10 mg/day which is my present dose. The full dose is actually 20mg/day, but I feel I am getting the results I need with 10mg, so there is no need to increase the dosage and risk any adverse side effects."
1392,mercaptopurine,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,crohn's disease,"I was prescribed the drug Mercaptopurine after two previous treatment drugs had begun to prove less effective than before.  The doctor started on a higher course of the medicine, but the dose is currently 100mg (2 pills) every evening.  There was a significant reduction in Crohn's disease symptoms, particularly general intestinal cramping.  This was particularly helpful for cramping that tended to occur as I was relaxing to go to sleep.","Though the Crohn's disease in itself makes me tired, and I feel that the addition of the Mercaptopurine has added to my general fatigue.  The fatigue abated somewhat as the dose was lowered (the doctor started at a more aggressive dose).  I also seem to catch every bug that is going around.  By suppressing my immune system I believe the Mercaptopurine makes it easier for seasonal illnesses to set up shop.","I was diagnosed with Crohn's disease about eight years ago.  The doctor started with a series of Remicade and a prescription of Prednisone. This combination made it possible for me to eat again - hurray!  As for maintenance drugs, I have been on several, including Asacol and Pentasa.  There were probably others, but those are the two that I definitely remember.  It seemed as though my body would react well to a drug, but then the drug eventually lost that initial effectiveness. I have been on Mercaptopurine for 3-4 years now, and am getting ready to ask to move to a new drug. Mercaptopurine seems to be continuing to do a good job as a drug, but I'd like to find one that may be less deleterious to my liver."

When I went back to teh doctor he told me he had to take me off the lamisil because it was harming my liver function. But by that time, the effect of teh medicine was enough for my nails to grow back after that. I think it was a change in climate, moving away from Astoria to a dryer climate of Portland.","When I saw the doctor 10 or so years ago, My nails were so bad, it was hard to look at them. The nails were thin and undernieth there was the infection of pus, so much that I had to clip the nails down and even pull one off; which wasnt difficult, because it was so weak, it just came right off. But after I took the lamisil, they grew back better, eventually."

However, I've not been prescribed/taken it for three years, also with no post-procedural infections.","Sleeplessness, easily bruised, diarrhea: the latter condition remained for up to a year or so AFTER I ceased taking Amoxicillin as a antibacterial antidote. I've not been prescribed/taken it for three years and the symptoms ceased. It's my understanding that this high-dosage, antidotal (dental) protocol is longer recommended.","To the best of my recollection (its been a while), the dentist(s) prescribed the 'standard' 2 - 4 500 mg. tablets to be taken 1 hour BEFORE any invasive procedure and the same dosage directly AFTER the procedure: cleaning, extraction, etc.: varying with dentist or procedure.

This peeling can easily be removed by sloughing off the peeling skin.  The benefits of Retin A Micro are unlike any skin product you could buy over the counter, used in conjunction with an effective sunscreen."

The nexxium has stopped my stomach from producing acid.,"After about a couple of months i began to experience severe stomach cramping, bloating, and diareaha.

It soothed the irritation and lessened the dermatitis rather quickly however, it was also used for what was thought as dermatitis around the mouth. Use continued for six months with no results. The rash was exacerbated by heat and a diagnosis of MRSA was made. The Clobex, due to steroids in the cream, did not clear the lesions but rather made them worse. Use was discontinued and Bactroban and Septra DS was highly effective at clearing the infection.

Over the years I have been given decreasing levels and am currently at .5mg. Even with the negative info regarding prolonged HRT, I opted to continue.  If you actually read the negative information, it was not related to estrogen, but rather to estrogen and progesterone in combination.

2584,betaseron,8,Highly Effective,Severe Side Effects,multiple sclerosis,"Storage of a drug may not seem important, but betaseron does not have to be refridgerated, which makes it highly portable.  But the main benefit is that the lesions that I was originally diagnosed with DID NOT WORSEN over time.  In addition,  I have had NO new lesions since beginning betaseron.  So this has helped to slow the progress (secondary progressive relapse/remit) and I believe decreased the amount of relapses with residual.

I will have a fever and/or chills, and I hurt all over.  It feels sometimes like even my hair hurts:)   And my injection sites do have a tendency to form large red circles, but they are NOT infections, just a side effect.  And for some reason the injections on my legs hurt the worst.","I guess the treatment details are how I take it.  The injections are deep subcutaneous.  Because the drug is very hard on tissue, you can't inject into the same area.  Upper arms are divided into 6 imaginary sections, abdomen 6 areas, legs 6 areas, and buttocks 6.  So inject into first arm area on one arm, then next injection opposite arm, then abdomen, legs, and buttocks.  Then you must start over in the first arm, but a different section and then work your way down again.  This keeps tissue necrosis from occuring.  The injections are every other night, and come in a pre-measured syringe the must be mixed SLOWLY with the powder immediately before injection.

I just wanted something to numb me again as things got better(which they did) but these tablets nearly sent me crazy.","I took one late at night hoping to feel sleepy at least, but had one of the worst nights sleep of my life. I encountered sweating,shakes, jaw grinding, and horrible hallucinatory dreams whilst still awake.  My GP told me I had to take them for at least a fortnight to feel any effect so tried again the following night, but the side effects were even worse. The way my jaw and teeth would involuntairily chatter was scary as hell. If I did this every sleepless night for 2 weeks, I'd have ended up insane, so I stopped after after just 2 nights","I never went back to the doctor. I was so desperate for a good nights sleep without teeth-grinding and nightmares, I fell back on alcohol. I've never taken Valium, but feel I should've been given something similar - somthing that would heavily sedate me while I was feeling suicidal. Luckily after a week, my fortunes changed, and I found work again, so the suicidal feelings went.  But I would never take Citalopram again."

3720,lamictal,7,Moderately Effective,No Side Effects,depression and anxiety,"Generally, Lamictal has helped my depression (intense sadness, hopelessness) more than my anxiety (obsessions, excessive worrying).

Patient decided to stop medication and try natural/alternative substance to thin the blood.  this resulted in an extension of the clot and increased severity of pain, leading to emergency room visit and subsequent use of different blood thinner, syntron.","Treatment included 2months of heparin injections in abdomen.  Coumadin was given daily after the injections were stopped, at 6mg. The discontinuation of this medication caused an extension of the clot and re-admittance to hospital and another drug for blood thinning was given.   Eventually, 6 months later, a doctor prescribed a compression stocking, which helped dramatically with swelling and pain.  The Syntron blood thinner had no noticeable side-effects.

I can concentrate better with this medication.",Taking prozac made me more sleepy and I could not get up to do everyday thing. I just kept sleeping or yawning.  I wanted my depresion to go away but it did the opposite. Instead of helping me keep me depresed I felted more depresed because I kept sleeping all the time. The medication Prozac with me did not help my depression but rather calm me to the extent that I did not want to do anything. Also I kept going to the bathroom constantly. It takes down my sexual mood and difficulty in getting aroused at all.  Ritalin cause my mouth to dry up and kept drinking water like a camel. Jittery effect and when the medication wear off you feel it like large thump.,Doctor suggested to take Prozac at night time and Ritalin twice a day. So far it has worked for me a patient suffering depression for more than 15 years and it has helped me the Ritalin. Cannot say about Prozac but I notice that I do not get anxiety attack with it.

of taking it, I noticed considerable improvement and then by the time the perscription was totally consumed, probably 10 days worth, the Strep throat was gone and all cleared up.  It was the second occasion of treating a similar illness that the side effects were detected.","After one day of taking the cipro- so probably had 3 pills, I began to get an itchy rash mostly on my arms, legs, and abdomen.

Trigylserides were normal before taking Crestor after weight loss.",Surprisingly no side effects with Crestor even though it is the most potent of the statins. I had severe muscle pains with Lipitor and other statins and expected to have the same problems with Crestor. For some reason I didn't have these problems with Crestor.,"I was started on 10mg and retested after 10 weeks. My LDL (bad cholesterol) dropped significantly, HDL rose slightly and triglyserides dropped slightly (they were already in the normal range before). My liver enzymes were high before taking Crestor but had returned to normal when retested after 10 weeks (I don't know if Crestor had anything to do with this or not). Blood sugar levels were normal before and after taking Crestor, but slightly lower after. I am due to be tested again before the end of this year and also have a Cardio Stress Test.

3745,lamictal,8,Considerably Effective,No Side Effects,mood stabilization,"The wellbutrin and effexor alone did improve the depression but the addition of the lamictal really made a significant improvement.  With just the two antidepressants I could still feel down and unmotivated, lethargic, hopeless at times.  But the lamictal prevented me from going down.  I have been diagnosed with dysthymia among other things and I have been told that there might be some sort of cycling akin to what manic-depressives have but of course not to that extreme.  The doctor was concerned initially about my diagnosis - the thought was that the diagnosis I had received (dysthimia) may have been wrong and really I was a manic-depressive (which I am not).  Apparently this is a mistake that can be made quite a bit.  This is what I thought was implied.  Boy have I been glad that someone came up with lamical.","There were no side effects.  If there were,(which I don't think there were) then they were so minimal as to go unnoticable by me. Some people say they are the type that has all the side effects.

I went to my doctor several times to try and find out what the trouble was.  I monitered my blood pressure several times a day and was put on Atacand which seemed to work well.  However, I found it made me so tired, that I took half a pill in the morning and half at night. Now my body has adjusted a lot, I am only on half the dose I started with. I also take a baby aspirin daily. I rely on Atacand to keep my blood pressure stable.

The docters had to remove the stone and I lost my kidney in the proses. After the operations my bladder became very sensitive. The docter prescribed bactroban everytime I got bladder infections. The infections did not go away. I started using Macrodantin. It worked for a few years, but later on I started getting infections even when I was on Macrodantin.

The pancreatitis subsided but the coughing worsened, especially at night.  I was diagnosed with acid reflux and ""hyperinflated lungs"", whatever that means.  The coughing would keep me up all night.  I saw both an allergist and a pulmonologist; the allergist prescribed Nexium and the pulmonologist prescribed Advair, the nasal spray with the bee spokesperson, and an inhaler that made me so jittery that I did not sleep for an entire night when I took it.  He also prescribed a codeine syrup that make me incredibly sick to my stomach.  I hated being on all those meds.

I expected that the treatment would be a cure not jsu a temporary relief.,I felt nauseous & bloated.,I experienced constipation as a side effect to pain meds from surgery.  I did not have previous problems with it.  It never got better even a long time after the surgery.  My doctor recommended I try amitiza after many over the counter products failed.

The outbreaks that I do have (if, for example, I don't take the Valtrex in time) seem not as bad as they would be without the Valtrex. The outbreaks seem somehow less... viral. As in, the sores may still form, but the entire process of blistering/opening/scabbing doesn't feel quite as much like my face is a nuclear radiation site.",,"I get horrible outbreaks in the center of my chin-- usually 5-8 sores clustered together all at once; really awful-looking. I'm aware of the things that trigger them, so when I realize there's a chance I might have an outbreak, even if I haven't felt the tingling yet, I'll take a couple of Valtrex and then I don't have an outbreak at all. I can't say for sure that it's the Valtrex stopping it (i.e. maybe I wouldn't have had an outbreak anyway in some cases) but it seems that way to me, and in any case it's nice to have some sense of control over the situation. Even though my outbreaks are awful, they only happen about 2x/year so I haven't felt it necessary to take the daily preventative pills."

I also had a strained muscle in lower back area which I also experienced relief from.

403,restasis,8,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,severe dry eyes,After 6 weeks began to reduce the itchy swollen eyes.  Long distance vision gradually cleared and returned to near normal.  After an additional three weeks the itchiness is continuing to reduce and the distance vision is continuing to improve.  Eyes are still itchy but I have gone from putting over-the-counter eye drops in my eyes more than 10x during an eight hour period to about 2x during an eight hour period.  I have improved from barely being able to read the top line of the eye chart to almost normal vision.,Severe burning sensation in eyes about one minute after applying drops.  This burning sensation did not always occur.  When the burning sensation occurred my eyes were photosensitive so I had to remain in a dark room for about 15 minutes.  I wore dark glasses for about one hour after leaving the dark room.  I put the eye drops in my eyes in the morning and before going to bed at night.  This meant some mornings I would be leaving for work at 6am (quite dark out) with dark glasses on as any amount of light was painful.,Had very dry itching eyes.  Difficult to determine if part was allergies.  Was referred to retinal specialist by my eye physician because of severely decreased vision.  Specialist prescribed the restasis and some different eye drops.  Returned in about 6 weeks with distinctly better vision but continued burning and itchy eyes.  Am to continue treatment and return in another six weeks.  Have noticed a reduction in itchiness since last visit and a small improvement in distance vision.

I take it at night, so the first 3-4 hours of each morning I experience the above side effects.

It was approximately 6 or 7 months before I was prescribed the Aricept.  The Aricept was prescribed to help the brain repair and re-connect (memory, executive reasoning: strategic planning, options, solutions, implementation, changes and follow-through). 

The side effects were worse the first 2-3 weeks on the 5 mg, then the 4th week, my body appeared to adjust and they became less intense. The 5th week, the doctor moved me up to 10 mg, and the side effects increased again. At that point, he took me off the Aricept and tried a competitors ""patch"" called Exelon. That didn't work well at all and set me back 5-6 weeks cognitively. 

Now I'm back on the 5mg of Aricept for the past 2 weeks and the plan is to stay on that dose for 6 months to a year. The side effects were the same at first, and are now getting better each day.

First the Doctor added Keppra and began weaning me off the Depakote ER 500mg pm. 250mg. am. It took awhile to get off Depakote because I kept having effects from being weaned off it after being on it for 25 years. Then a few months later he started to wean me off of diamox, which I stopped a week ago, after a long process of being weaned off that drug.

The combination works much better.,,"Since being diagnosed with hypothyroidism, my doctor�s would treat with basically the Levothyroxine.  The levels would be increased until I was �in the range�, but I never felt quite right.  I was still very tired and my memory, especially short-term, was really bad.  I went to a couple endocrinologists, with the first one diagnosing the hypothyroidism as a result of Hashimoto�s disease.  Even with this diagnosis, the first endocrinologist did not suggest other treatments and I continued to suffer with excessive tiredness and memory problems.  I decided to go for a second opinion, and this endocrinologist told me that some individuals react better with a combination treatment of Levothyroxine and Cytomel.  This seemed to turn me around.  The memory and tiredness have gotten better, still not optimal.  It seems as long as one is �in the range�, doctors are hesitant to push the envelope.  I would like to see physicians listen to their patients and adjust the meds until they feel better, not just go �by the range�."

I no longer felt the ""looming dread"" that comes with a panic attack and I just felt calmer and more in control than before. I was finally able to get my life back and felt more at ease.","I went off of Zoloft on my own in October of 2008. I went down gradually from 50mg to 25 for about a week and then went off completely. The two weeks afterward were a bit crazy. The panic attacks didn't come back but I'd get all emotional at the slightest upset and feel like crying for no reason (which isn't me at all). I also had the strangest, most vivid dreams. I recently went back on the drug after the panic attacks came back and apart from slight dizzyness and diarrhea I'm starting to feel more in control again and less panicky.",My family doctor prescribed it for panic attacks. I saw a psychiatrist years ago but it really didn't do much apart from giving me tips on what to do constructively if I have a panic attack. Which of course didn't help because when you're paralyzed with fear you can't do much of ANYTHING constructive with your time.
1587,xanax,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,anxiety attacks,"It was calming within a very short time.  At the onset of an attack, just having the medicine on hand was calming. It began to work very quickly after taking it.","It made me a little bit too sleepy.  It also was relaxing to the point that I felt a little disoriented.  It was a great solution as long as I was at home.  It would not have been practical to take when working, driving, etc.","It was prescribed to be taken on an as needed basis.

I was having quite a bit of back pain and about a year ago started lifting moderate weights about 3 days a week and that seemed to clear up the problem. Sometimes when I overeat or accidently drink a lot of alcohol I get extreme chest pain. I actually break out into a sweat and the pain works from center of my back to front of my chest. After it subsides which is usually 15 to 20 minutes I will be extremely exhaused.The first time it happened I thought I was actually having a heart attack.So to counter the issue I try to eat less at a meal and nibble more often during the day.

Had to continually change dosage. The medication for hyperthyroid also can cause birth defects. I was anticipating having children within a few years. I went in and had the radio active iodine. After one month my thyroid was destroyed. Had tried generic brands of synthroid but was still expereincing changes in my thyroid level. My doctor perscribed only name brand syntroid and it has been at a cosistant level for at least 5 years.,When taking synthroid it must be taken on an empty stomach around the same time every day. Multivitamins with Iron decrease the sythroids effectiveness so they must be taken at least 3 hours after taking sythroid. Never miss a dosage. I once missed a few days in a row and became very depressed almost suicidal. Will need to take sythroid for the rest of my life and keep regular appointments to have my thyroid levels checked.,The radio active iodine treatment was conducted as outpatient surgery at the local hospital. I was given a pill to swallow. I was then asked to come back after 6 hours to have a scan done of my thyroid. I came back the next day for another scan. After one week I had a blood test and was perscribed synthroid. I have my thyroid checked on an annual basis. In some cases depending on any changes in my thyroid levels I have had to go back on a six month check up schedule.

This was the only side effect I experienced and as long as you can be organised about when you eat and take the tablets then it causes no problems at all.  Given the fact I relied on these tablets for 3 years, the side effects were extremely mild and forgettable.","The treatment was for my back pain, this was lower back pain caused by a slipped disk.

I am prescribed to take it ""as needed"" which means that I don't take it everyday.  I tend to take it most school days (med school) and take more of it during testing times.  I am prescribed to take it up to 3 times a day, but I rarely have taken that much.","If I take a 5 mg pill later than 3 pm or so it is difficult to fall asleep.  I sometimes get jittery or feel like my heart is racing.  Sometimes I have strange muscle twitches that I can't control.  Some days it makes me lose my appetite completely, which doesn't sound bad but I'm already a little underweight.","Since I control when I take the meds (what time, how much- up to 3 per day) I think I have over-done it on occasion, even though it was never above what I'm perscribed.  Some days I will take 3 pills so I can truly concentrate, and then can't sleep. . . may have to take a sleeping pill. . . wake up feeling awful and groggy. . . and have to do the whole viscious cycle all over again.  So, even though I'm doing what I'm perscribed to do, it can be too much for me.  I can understand why there is abuse potential with this drug, as you start feeling dependent on it.

About 10 years later I had severe bladder pain, but no infection was present.

It was recommended that I be certain to apply it directly after a shower, when the skin still retains some of it's moisture from the shower itself. This is true for all lotions, but seemed particularly helpful with the Lac-hydrin. Unfortunately, though it was more helpful than many lotions I've used, the benefits did not warrant the higher price of the product. Ultimately, I've found BETTER results with the much cheaper Eucerin and even Curel moisturizing lines.","During the 6 months during which I used the Lac-hydrin, I didn't experience any negative side-effects. I was using it during winter months, so I don't have any feedback to offer on sun-sensitivity. I didn't experience any additional skin irritation that lessened my interest in the product. I simply moved on to other products because of the price.","The Lac-hydrin was applied topically to all parts of my body (expect my face) twice daily.

This proved to be correct. He told me to mix a pea sized portion with my usual moisturiser but to only use it once a day, I used it at night. He also stipulated that it was very important to use an effective sun block as Retinova increased sensitivity to sunlight. A number of people commented on the improvement in my skin. After about 12 months a large, brown patch of sun damage on my temple flaked off and didn't come back. I was very disappointed when I went to get my usual 3 month prescription and was told that Retinova was no longer available. I have subsequently used Retin-A but without the same visible results. This wasn't prescribed by the original dermaltologist, he didn't believe Retin-A was suitable for what I wanted to achieve for my skin. Over the counter products containing retinol do help smoothness a little, but nothing compared to the dramatic changes I experienced when I used Retinova. What amazed me the most was how quickly some of the changes occurred, within only a matter of days."

3677,effexor-xr,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,"anxiety, mild depression","Venlafaxine is a bicyclic antidepressant, and is usually categorized as a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), but it has been referred to as a serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor. It works by blocking the transporter ""reuptake"" proteins for key neurotransmitters affecting mood, thereby leaving more active neurotransmitters in the synapse. The neurotransmitters affected are serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). Additionally, in high doses it weakly inhibits the reuptake of dopamine, with recent evidence showing that the norepinephrine transporter also transports some dopamine as well, implying that SNRIs may also increase dopamine transmission. This is because SNRIs work by inhibiting reuptake, i.e. preventing the serotonin and norepinephrine transporters from taking their respective neurotransmitters back to their storage vesicles for later use. If the norepinephrine transporter normally recycles some dopamine too, then SNRIs will also enhance dopaminergic transmission. Therefore, the antidepressant effects associated with increasing norepinephrine levels may also be partly or largely due to the concurrent increase in dopamine (particularly in the prefrontal cortex).",Difficulty in reaching orgasm. Increased amount of ejaculate. Rare mild headache.,"My uptake levels were not severely out of balance. I started with 150 mg and felt the positive effects in 20 minutes. I was told it would take a week. I reduced the dosage to 75 mg then 37.5 mg after six months because I felt those doses to be too strong. I know others that found this drug helpful.

2018,bystolic,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,heart palpitations,"I have had SVT's all my life.  It was only when I turned 24 that I sought treatment for them as they usually were linked with a syncope episode.  I was originally put on the grandfather of beta/alpha blockers inderal.  While this drug was effective at treating my migraines, it was not particularly effective at controlling my palpitations and it tended to lower my blood pressure too much.  I always felt tired and had little energy on this drug.  At 24 years of age I was not happy to have the energy of a 65 year-old.  Next came atenolol and labatolol (when I was pregnant).  I also had break-through palpitations with these drugs as well as low-enegy side effects.  With labetolol I could barely jog down my street without becoming significantly winded and according to my cardiologist I fell into the 94th percentile for ""in-shape"" people my age.  Finally, when bystolic hit the market I was thrilled.  First of all I didn't need a large dose of it to be effective.  Second, it was effective.  I experience no break-through palpitations, and last but not least there were very few to no side effects.  I had energy again and I could get throught my cardiovascular exercise without becoming winded.","The beta blocker controls and regulates your heart beat so it beats on time when it's supposed to.  It also however, controls your heart rate and doesn't allow it to race out of control.  So when exercising, many people have a hard time being able to get their heart rate up to pump enough blood to the lungs which is why you feel winded while exercising even mildly.  With Bystolic there is very little of this type of side effect.  Sometimes I don't notice it at all.",I take 2.5mg of Bystolic one time per day to control palpitations.  This drug is commonly prescribed for hypertension but I do not take it for that.  At this dose it does not lower my already low blood pressure very much but it is effective against the palpitations.

There was some relief after a couple of days on this drug. However, some days I felt as poorly as I did without them.  But after approximately 8 weeks almost all of the discomfort was gone.  I feel pretty normal.  One key to making this work is to deliberately not urinate too often.  I have noticed that now I sometimes need to remind myself to go.

At that time Prilosec with still not yet over the counter, still requiring a physician prescription.  It worked beautifully and I have taken it since, daily.  If I don't take it, symptoms immediately occur after eating.   It does NOT however stop the cough that occurs after eating or otherwise from GERD. Recently, I have had to increase my dose ""occasionally"" to 1 pill also before dinner, but that is usually only if I'm eating later than expected.

1952,lyrica,9,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,neuropathy / anklosing spondylytis,"Lyrica reduced the pain associated with my anklosing spondylytis when other therapies had failed.  I had tingling, numbness, pain, and very limited movement in my arms and legs from A.S. after developing 6 moderate sized bone spurs on my cervical spine.  It was severely limiting my ability to have any sort of life.  I have tried almost every form of pain killer from OTC to narcotics with very limited effects.  Lyrica works differently and I find that I can be RELATIVELY pain free.  It does not totally eliminate the pain but what it does is make it bearable so that I can function.  I could take more of it according to my doctor but I am more comfortable taking the lowest possible dose.  I've noticed that I have no more tingling, very little numbness, and a greatly expanded range of motion without pain.  I highly recommend this drug!","The treatment side effects are somewhat severe.  The first dose I took almost immediately knocked me out!  I was so out of it, loopy, sleepy, etc. that all I could do is sit around and then go to sleep! It didn't get better after a couple of doses and I originally stopped taking it.  My doctor helped me build up a tolerance by stepping up the dosage over a week or so.  That limited the side effects but I still find that if I miss a dose by even a couple of hours, I start going through withdrawal and start feeling AWFUL!  I don't feel better until I get the dose!  That is somewhat scary to me and keeps me from trying a higher dose but the benefits of having a ""normal"" life outweigh the side effects and I dont' know of any safer options to do that.","Treatment details?  I guess you are asking for how often, etc.?  I am on ongoing therapy.  I take one in the morning and one in the evening.  I try to keep my dosage schedule very precise because I pretty quickly show signs of withdrawal if I miss any.  It has allowed me to start physical therapy, which was previously unavailable because of the pain.

Experienced periods of sleeplesness at night.","I would set the alarm for 6am, take ritalin, go back to sleep until 7am. This gave the ritalin time to kick in so I could feel awake when I arose.

1139,methadone,10,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,opiate dependence,"I have been able to maintain sobriety and get my life back on track.  Methadone has allowed me to get my ""bearings"" underneath me, and really focus on what is important in life once again. After about 6 months, I began working and have been promoted consistently since then.  I am currently tapering and am really trying to be smart about it.  While I am very eager to be off methadone, I also do not want to rush it.  I feel that methadone should be one of the last options a person looks to when trying to stop opiate use because it isn't something that can be stopped whenever a person feels ready.  I have found it to be quite a complex task.","WEIGHT GAIN, WEIGHT GAIN, WEIGHT GAIN!!  I don't know if it's just because of the methadone slowing your metabolism, or if it is caused by the need to eat sweets but I have gained at least 90 lbs since starting methadone 7 years ago. It is likely a combination of both.  I have also seen a sever decline with my teeth, and the only cause I can think of is methadone.  I have taken such good care of my teeth, as far as self care and making sure I see the dentist every 6 months, and that still hasn't helped.  Has anyone else noticed this?  I have started having sever pain in my joints as well, especially my knees.  I can honestly say though, that without this medication I probably wouldn't be alive to experience any of these minor side effects.  Without a doubt, methadone along with the therapy I received while in the clinic and my families support has saved my life. I will take the weight gain and minor discomfort any day, at least I am here to write about it.","I had tried many times to get sober before beginning MMT.  I started methadone after 3 unsuccessful tries at in-patient and outpatient therapy.  When I first began treatment, I traveled 2 hours a day to received the dosage.  After about a year I was lucky enough to get in to a clinic closer to my home but by that time, I had completed all of the necessary counseling hours and had also received all clean swabs and urine tests and was given 3 day take homes.  Eventually that was extended to 6 days which is the most in my state or clinic that you are allowed. It has been about 7 years now, and I am in a total good place in life and feel that it's time to start tapering.  I have held the same job for almost 5 years, have a car, have my finances somewhat in order and am ready to move on to the next phase.  While I have had a relatively easy time of tapering, I had to stop for a couple of weeks because I started feeling some slight stomach cramping and body aches.  I made the decision to go down 2 mgs a week in hopes that such a small amount per week would allow my body to easily adjust to the change.  So far so good and I am hoping that by next summer I will be completely done."

I take one pill in the morning, and one in the evening.","I see a psychiatrist regularly.  He originally prescribed me Prozac many years ago, when I started seeing him after my husband left me abruptly alone with a three-year old son.  I felt like I was losing my mind.

1250,catapres,7,Moderately Effective,No Side Effects,sleep disruption due to hotflashes at night,"I am sleeping more deeply, especially during the first four or five hours after falling asleep.  I still have hot flashes during those hours, however I seem to be in a deeper state of sleep and during those hours I usually don't fully awake during the hot flash, as I used to do.  I used to be almost fully awake every time I experienced a hot flash (every 1 to 1.5 hours).  Now I get a few hours of fairly good sleep at the beginning of my sleep cycle.",There are no adverse side effects so far.  Some nights I don't sleep as deeply (as described above) during the first few hours of sleep.  I'm not sure what makes the difference from one night to the next-perhaps the amount of sleep I got in the few nights previous.,"I take one tablet at bedtime.  I try to delay taking it until I'm just about ready to go to sleep, since the effect is most pronounced in the first few hours after taking the tablet.  Later in the sleep cycle, my hot flashes wake me up more fully, as they have for the last four years."
334,neurontin,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,difficulty sleeping because of nervous system prob,"Helped to promote sleep without side effects, hangover or any of the other problems associated with other sleep medications.  The sleep difficulty was caused by a horrible reaction to another medication called Celexa, which appeared to sensitize my nervous system even after the Celexa was stopped.

Doc told me to only take tramadol in cases where the pain was severe and not to mix with my muscle relaxer (flexeril).  Tramadol did do a decent job of taking away the pain and helping me sleep.,"I took tramadol once, that's all it took for me to decide I didn't want to take it again.  I took it in the evening and went to sleep a few hours later, it made me very sleepy.  Upon waking up in the morning I felt extremely nauseous, shaky and - it's hard to explain, I felt inside my head a lot.  Very cloudy headed.  I thought I'd feel better if I took a shower but ended up throwing up b/c I just couldn't stand up, all I wanted to do was lie down.  I felt very dizzy. I laid down for about 10 mins and felt a little better, stomach was still upset though.  I ate something and immediately felt nauseous, was shaking uncontrollably and sweating.  I threw up again.  The episodes continued through most of the day.  But I felt better as time went on.  I decided the side effects just aren't worth it!",Overall Tramadol just isn't work the side effects I experienced.  I'd rather take a few Aleve and deal with the left over pain.

I did as instructed and all the abnormal skin cells were gone but I was left with small pink colored scars all over my chest.  I have worked for about 2 years applying many different things to even my skin tone back up with only limited success.

742,flonase,9,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,sinus congestion / allergies,My dry cough and sinus infections were virtually eliminated.,some light nasal bleeding and a dry mouth when not taken precisely as directed.  It's important not to let the medication go too far into the nasal passage so that it doesn't go down the back of the throat which will lead to dry mouth.,When I began taking flonase I was experiencing at least annual sinus infections and waking frequently from a dry/choking cough.

1398,nardil,9,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,depression (atypical),"A dramatic decrease in the level of depression and a great increase in a feeling of well-being and hope for the future.  There were also considerable cognitive benefits: thought processes speeded up, memory became stronger and intellectual creativity increased.  Also the constant fatigue that accompanied the depression decreased and this made possible an exercise program that increased energy and enjoyment of strenuous activities.  In addition my general and social anxiety decreased dramatically.","The most troublesome side effect was faintness upon rising quickly from a seated (or horizontal) position.  On one occasion I lost consciousness and fell.  However, this side effect went away after three months or so.  There was also some decrease in sexual desire, but this side effect also lessened over time.  A side effect that seems to be permanent is lower blood pressure, but this is actually a benefit for most people.  I've been told that some people take MAOI's solely to decrease their blood pressure.","It takes some time to build up to a clinical dosage.  As I recall, my doctor had me take 15mg for a weak, 30mg for two weeks, 45mg for two weeks until I had built up to 75mg.  I did not begin to feel the antidepressant effect until I reached 45mg. When I reached 60mg the antidepressant effect had kicked in fully and I even experienced a period (two or three weeks) of a mild euphoria, which I have been told is fairly typical.  My doctor thought that a slow buildup of the drug in my system was the most effective treatment.  He also had me taking Lamictal (150mg per day), which he thought might spark a stronger reaction to Nardil.  There are also some diet restrictions: no aged cheeses and no aged meats.  Also, some cold medications must be avoided."

3294,zoloft,7,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,traumatic brain injury,"Zoloft made me feel considerably better, which is to say it decreased the severity and frequency of my ""why me"" or ""I suck"" bouts, but the underlying facts were still the same.","There was a definite decrease in sexual desire and performance, but it is hard to say if the zoloft is to be blamed for everything.","I was put on zoloft while still in the hospital having suffered a Traumatic Brain Injury. I was just taking whichever pills the doctors set out for me, and when i left the hospital i just continued taking zoloft, because i knew i was going to be depressed. I continued taking it for about a year and a half after leaving the hospital but eventually wanted to try living with a clear mind. When I stopped the dosage gradually (as one is well advised) I went on living ok, but was still depressed. I was looking for something to take my mind off the recovery, so of course i dabbled in alcohol and the occasional marijuana use, but I eventually went on to realize that i didn't need any drugs at all. There is something to be said for a natural high, but i decided to put myself back on the lowest dose of zoloft in hopes of clearing my mind so that i could go back to school without the depression hampering my focus."

375,lamotrigine,1,Ineffective,Severe Side Effects,migraines,None.  Had to discontinue use after three days because of severe side effects!,"Within hours of taking the first dose I had vaginal itching.  Since I read that was a side effect in the paperwork, I didn't think much of it.  After two doses, the itching turned to a burning and sourness in the pubic area.  I thought it might have been irritation from wearing leggings with no underwear (from the seam).  The medication was taken at bedtime.  When I woke up after taking the third dose, I had blisters on the outer labia.  Late that night, while on an hour+ drive home from a nearby city, I was in severe pain.  The blisters got worse, severe headache, severe backache, chills and all over aches like the flu.  During the drive, I felt so bad I was praying for my life so I could continue to raise my children, even though I do not believe in god!  It is now the next day after that horrendous drive.  My blisters continue to worsen; my entire pubic area is sore, itching and burning; and I have developed a swollen lump on each side of my pubic area that is extremely tender and painful.  I have not taken my temperature but I'm sure I have one.  I feel like I have the flu plus all the gynecological problems.  I'm no doctor, but I highly urge any woman on this med that they discontinue use IMMEDIATELY upon ANY gynecological disturbances, no matter how minor you think they might be.  The goose eggs in my bikini area continue to grow and become more tender.",My neurologist that prescribed the med told me to see my primary gyn if symptoms are not gone a week after discontinuation.  Isn't that nice!  I live in a rural town and don't have an established gyn right now so it just is not a good situation.  BEWARE!!!
1216,prozac,5,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,mild depression and anxiety,"So far, I have experienced an uplift in mood and a dulling of anxious reactions and PMS symptoms.  I can't say it's all due to the Prozac, as I'm employing CBT methods, but my anxiety has not escalated into a full blown attack and I generally feel a lot better about life and about myself.  I'm still weighing if these benefits are worth all of the symptoms I'm experiencing.  It's been hard to maintain a positive outlook when I don't feel normal due to the trembling and tremoring.","Immediately after beginning treatment I experienced heartburn and nausea that would come in waves all day long.  Due to this, I lost 6 pounds in a 3 week period (worrisome because I am a normal weight).  About a week and a half later the nausea started to subside, but then I noticed I was feeling very stimulated. It was as if I could actually feel energy rushing in my body, and had to keep moving or get up and do something with myself. Soon after this began, I started experiencing trembling and tremors/twitches in my hands, arms, legs, feet, and neck.  Generally the tremoring subsides when I am up and moving, (e.g. walking), but when I start to relax (e.g. sitting or lying down) I tend to feel it more.  At first there was a twitch here and there, but now it happens very frequently and all over.  No sexual side effects noted yet.","I was prescribed Prozac for managing mild depression and anxiety attacks in conjunction with weekly counseling and cognitive behavorial therapy methods.  when the trembling and tremoring began, I went back to the counseling center to ask about them.  The psychiatrist had said some people react to Prozac in that fashion and that the side effects wane in time.  I also read that stimulating effects such as those were actually fairly common in Prozac users.  I go back to MY Psychiatrist in two days to discuss the effectiveness of the pill, the side effects I'm experiencing, and whether or not we should continue."

831,zegerid,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,gastritis,The symptoms of the gastritis resolved completely within 12 hours after the first dose and were not experienced at all while on the treatment. There were no troublesome side effects compromising compliance. The once daily dose was also ameanable to comlpeting the course of treatment with ease.,None were encountered thus ensuring compliance as stated above.,The once daily dose was extremely effective in controlling the debilitating symptoms of gastritis and maintaining the symptom-free period while the treament was taken. There were no side-effects encountered which would have otherwise compromised compliance. The treatment is highly recommended!
3784,keflex,2,Ineffective,No Side Effects,,None.  I had a bacterial infection accompanying my flu and there wasnt a single noticeable benefit.,"The only good point I suppose is that there was no adverse reaction, such as yeast infection or stomach upset. The downside was the bacterial infection quickly got worse.",Absoutely innefective.  I easily could have been takign a sugar pill for those results.

Then, the daily dosage needed to be increased to twice daily.  At twice daily, the same effectiveness has been maintained.  It definitely controls the GERD & heartburn.  At one point, I tried to come off this medication (to have a more natural lifestyle) this was a huge mistake as I immediately had a return of severe heartburn & reflux."

Reduced to 1000 mg per day and sought alternative methods..research by Harvard showed magnesium deficit in those with seizure disorders..began magnesium injections and increased essential fatty acids..through proper nutrition, supplementation and accupuncture, no more seizure medication and seizure free...do want to note that seizures began during the spraying of the neurotoxin anvil for the West Nile virus."
282,xyrem,8,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,narcolepsy/cataplexy,"Before taking Xyrem I had to take a daily nap to feel refreshed. I had vivid hallucinations and I had to control my emotions.I would also get up to use the restroom approximately 10 times at night. Since i started taking Xyrem, I stopped taking those daily naps, no more hallucinations and I am able to laugh;cry more with less muscle weakness. Eventhough I only sleep for 6-7 hours max, I wake up feeling refreshed.","When I take the first dose I noticed that I dont have trouble falling asleep.

2915,tramadol,6,Moderately Effective,Moderate Side Effects,acl reconstruction,I found tramadol quite effective before and after surgey to reconstruct my knee (acl).,side effects however ocurred almost straight away on intial dose of 100mg.The worst of which is a constant feeling of tiredness and lack of energy.This has not subsided even after a year of taking this medaction. Other side effects i have experienced are blurred vision and on the rare occasion mild muscle spasms.I also have found this drug to be addictive with a feeling of nervousness mixed with mild depression if a dose is missed.,100mg twice daily seems to work well for myself however if you can get away with taking co codamol i would recomend this first. co codamol worked wonders for me for the first 3 months however i soon built up a very high tolerance and was taking 60mg of codiene 4 times a day to get any effect hence the change to tramadol.
343,neurontin,1,Considerably Effective,Severe Side Effects,migraines,"My migraines did decrease significantly while on this medication. There was a clear inverse correlation between my Neurontin dosage and my migraine frequency and severity (more neurontin, fewer migraines)","I was a zombie. Some aspects of this subsided over the first year, however others did not. My vocabulary suffered horribly and never really recovered. I went from being a very well spoken person to someone struggling to grasp some words over three letters. Coworkers even mentioned to me that they noticed this effect. My memory suffered horribly as well. I would have to cut back on my dosage during exam times (I was in school as well as working at the time). There seemed to be absolutely no way for me to memorized the volume of work I needed to while on this drug.

The sleepiness I experienced was awful. This diminished somewhat but never entirely over the four years I took it. A couple of times I had to pull over while driving; staying awake seemed to be out of my control entirely. The sleepiness was overwhelming at times. I once fell asleep while speaking one on one with a coworker. While on Neurontin I also had an annoying tendency to forget what I was saying mid-sentence--very embarrassing in a professional setting. Since abandoning Neurontin and switching to Lamictal I no longer have this problem.","Used as a migraine prophylactic, my Dr. simply increased my dosage over time from what I believe was 300mg. per day up to 2400 over approximately two months. I was to take the medicine throughout the day but I sometimes opted to take a bulk of the total dose at night before bed--the fatigue it produced in me did assist my sleep. Unfortunately no matter when I took it my sleep was also assisted while in my car or at my desk at work! This decreased over time but was still in certain circumstances a danger. I will say however, it did decrease my migraines--the greater my neurontin dose the less my migraines. But I opted to take my migraines over falling asleep driving, possibly killing others or myself. Unfortunately my physician did not take this side effect seriously the many times I told her; after three years of this she continued to insist this side effect would subside. It did lessen but NEVER subsided to a safe level. She's no longer my physician and I now take Lamictal."
2698,detrol-la,8,Moderately Effective,Moderate Side Effects,bladder pressure,"For the most part, the pressure feeling I constantly had in my bladder went away.  Sometimes, especially in the middle of the night, the pressure would return slightly.  Instead of having to go to the bathroom 2-3 times during the night, I was able to only have to get up to urinate once a night.","I would wake up with a very hoarse voice.  Usually, the hoarsness would disappear during the day, but sometimes my voice would crack when I spoke.  Also, your throat is dry and irratated.  It's almost like you feel like you're getting a bad sore throat but it never quite turns into one.  My mouth was a little dry, but hardly noticable.","I was prescribed it after a bladder infection, which was cleared up, lead to a pressure feeling in my bladder.  I take the medicine once a day.  I guess the medicine is slow releasing but once in a while I felt like I should take a dose earlier than prescribed.  I am also scheduled for physical therapy on the muscles of my bladder wall, but have not started them yet.  I did this kind of therapy 10 years ago when my bladder had this same pressure feeling and the therapy did help--I'm looking forward to starting it and hopefully getting off the medication."
2802,wellbutrin,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,smoking cessation,"The idea is to take one pill each day for three days and then up the dose to twice per day.  At day 10 the patient is to stop smoking altogether.  I did this and found that in fact by day 8 or 9 I felt an eversion to smoking.  
Niggling cravings every few days trickled to a craving once a week or so which is weak and easily overcome. 
The prescription is typically for 3 months but I didn't need any refills at all.  I stopped taking the drug after a month or so.
I recommend this drug ONLY UNDER THE CARE OF A PHYSICIAN to anyone interested in stopping smoking once and for all.  
Certainly a person must be commited to the decision to quit smoking though or save your money.","The most obvious side effect for me was difficulty sleeping.  
Hard to take but I knew that it would be temporary and I knew that I would rather have spotty sleep for as much as a few weeks in trade for not smoking ever again.
The difficulty sleeping didn't last long into the treatment, though.  A week maybe.  
I remember reading about other side effects like a dry mouth, but the most alarming one is possible seizures.  Talk to your doctor.","Treatment details are above (oops).

The Flexeril was effective in relaxing my muscles enough to make this merely a slight sensation within about twenty minutes, and over aperiod of one two two months the problem went away entirely.","I do not feel that I experienced any truly negative side effects or have any adverse reactions to the Flexeril.  If I was tired, the muscle relaxing effect would end up making me sleepy, and if I took it right before going to sleep it might be a little harder to wake up in the morning. But, to me it seems like that just meant it was doing what it was intended to do.","I was prescribed Flexeril (10mg) for a muscle spasm in my neck that was pinching a nerve to my right arm.  I took the ten miligrams of Flexeril three times a day for about a month as needed as it was prescribed.

I was 'lucky' that I did not gain weight, but I was almost totally unable to lose weight despite diligent nutrition and exercise.

The medication also increased my heart rate.  I was unable to take it at night (which is the common prescribing practice) as the accelerated heart rate would keep me awake.  Taking it in the AM seemed to work around this problem but may have caused some daytime fatigue/sleepiness (this is why is it usually prescribed to be taken at night).","I began at 10mg then worked up to a 50mg dose.  I had relatively good suppression of depressive symptoms at all doses, higher doses being better.  The higher doses did not seem to increase the weight gain/heart rate side effects any more than the lower doses (as in non-dose-dependent effects)."

My doctor assured me that Seasonique was safe and I shouldn't have any severe side effects. After only a couple weeks, I started experiencing headaches and extreme breast tenderness. I didn't think much of it at first, but then I started experiencing more side effects. I have been blessed with great skin, only having a few pimples throughout my lifetime. However, after being on Seasonique for about a month, I started to notice my skin was frequently breaking out. I didn't want to stop taking birth control, so I figured I would give it a little bit longer to adjust to my body. About a month and a half into taking Seasonique, I began to breakthrough bleed. I had a full blown period for exactly 3 weeks. I consulted my doctor about a week into the period and she assured me it was totally normal. While on Seasonique, I could definitely feel significant changes in my body that were not normal for me. For these reasons, I would NOT recommend Seasonique to anyone."

It takes roughly 20 minutes to one half of an hour to take effect.  If I don't go directly to bed after taking it, if I stay up watching tv or reading, when I start to feel the effects I give in and go to bed immediately.  I have got into doing something and fought it off before and sometimes you can overcome it, but another time I accidently took it with my morning vitamines and was not able to go to work.

She had a sinus infection that we couldn't get rid of with natural remedies (salt water flush, tea, elevated sleeping) so we went the antibiotic route.","Her side effects were almost immediate thoug it took my husband and I 3 doses (3 days) to figure it out.  For an almost three year old, her moods were fairly predictable.  She was irritable when she was hungry, tired, or needed to poop.  But about 24 hours after her first dose of Cefdinir! Her moods drastically changed to violent, out-of-control, scary, temper tantrums.  To the point where she was biting herself, Banging her head on the wall and hitting and kicking us with all her might.  And when we would try and stop her, it was like she didn't recognize us and would get scared and cry. 

It was disturbing and very upsetting for us a parents. We started doing research the next day and little info on the drug except for druglib.com and the official side effect page. We found drastic mood changes buried in the side effects information and discontinued use.

Our doctor didn't seem that concerned even after we explained the scary details. He prescribed aZ Pack for her symptoms and she has been fine ever since (we have a new doctor now though).",Our daughter completed her treatment with a z pack.
510,amerge,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,migraines,Amerge is effective in reducing the pain and associated symptoms of migraines.,"Mild drowsiness, sometimes mild nausea.","I have very severe migraine disease and have tried many different treatments.  None are effective 100% of the time.  In my experience, Amerge is the most effective for mild and moderate migraines (Nothing seems to work for severe attacks). I prefer Amerge because the beneficial effects seem to last longer than many of the other anti-migraine meds (often 18-24 hrs.). Also, side effects seem to be negligible(No palpitations and dizziness like with imitrex). The downside is that Amerge takes longer to work (2-4 hrs) than the other triptans. But because of the better safety profile and the longer duration of effectiveness, for me Amerge is a top choice for migraines."

I was very bloated and uncomfortable.  I think I gained a couple of pounds too and I had only been using it for a week.,The doctor thought I should try the patch because it would bypass my liver.

I would wash my face and wait 10 minutes so the skin was completely dry for application. I applied the cream to the cheek area and spread outward trying to avoid the sensitive corners of the mouth, nose & eyes. I decreased the amount when I began to get some peeling and then took a break from treatment when I got obvious irritation. At this point, the treatment has to be on and off a schedule to avoid the side effects."

3169,prednisone,1,Moderately Effective,Severe Side Effects,allergic reaction on face to a cosmetic,"Facial swelling reduced dramatically over 3 days, only to return (less so) as a side effect.  I could have just taken Benadryl, and although it would have taken longer to recover from the allergic reaction (possibly another week), I would have been normal without side effects, and without withdrawal effects.  The drug took a modest problem and created a far worse one.  I told the physician I reacted strongly to drugs.  Since then I've learned that some physicians are quite blas� about the side effects of prednisone -- apparently that old adage about ""first do no wrong"" is no longer important.","constant :    pulse pounding throughout body, flushed face, odd-looking eyes (dilated), high blood pressure ( systolic range 145-194; ), fatigue, severe insomnia, nervousness, inability to concentrate, mild vertigo (spill, drop, lurch, and fall).

With the provigil, along with my other medications, I am able to balance day and night and not feel like I'm fighting to keep my eyelids open.  Also, I don't need any caffeine or other stay awake medications that are harmful and habit-forming.","During the first week, my heart rate increased as I increased the dose, but now my heart rate is perfectly normal.

3133,duragesic,7,Highly Effective,Severe Side Effects,severe chronic pain,"Extremely effective in reducing long-term, chronic pain (muskoskeltal and nerve), especially as a long-acting, baseline pain reducer in combination with a break-thru medication (I used Hydrocodone APAP and/or Percocet) for spikes in pain levels (due to falls, joint dislocations, broken bones, etc that cause temporary or short-term increases in pain.)","It is a very strong opioid, which is highly sedating, especially in combination with other drugs that can cause drowsiness. Even though I am very opioid-tolerant, it was still sedating for me.  In addition to causing drowsiness and fatigue, it tends to be highly habit-forming.  Because of the strength and nature of the drug, the human body becomes physically dependent on it, which has a few implications.  First, it loses efficacy over time, meaning you need to keep increasing the dosage over time to maintain the same effectiveness. The other issue with physical dependence is withdrawal.  I had severe physical withdrawal symptoms if I waited too long to change the patch (starting a day or so after I was scheduled to change it and becoming more and more severe with time.)  Several specialists I saw actually recommended hospitalization for controlled dose reduction as the safest way to stop taking fentanyl patches because they cause such severe physical withdrawal symptoms.  I withdrew from it completely 3 times, and suffered severe, debilitating symptoms for the first couple of weeks each time with decreasingly severe symptoms lasting for over a month after I stopped using it.  Although I have never had an issue with psychological dependence on any drug, I think it is important to mention that this one can be very addictive (meaning that those who take it frequently develop a psychological dependence, especially if the user is prone to substance abuse.)","I took Duragesic as a long-term maintenance medication on several different occasions, but it can be taken permanently as long as it remains effective."

Without this medication, I would not be able to work, let alone do much of anything else.","Yes, there are side effects.  Constipation is an issue that requires trying different means to address.  Tradition treatments didn't help, but odd ones that I stumbled on have - like eating raw brazil nuts; now it's home-made chex mix.  NutriSystems food (with high fiber and fillers) really works.

There is a mild, physical addiction property.  Over the ten years that I have used this medication, I have slowly reduced by dosage from 50 mg down to 30 daily.  There was nauseousness and sweating, but I got through it.

When people say that prescription medicine isn't safe, I can only reply that my choices are either laying in bed because the pain is to great, or taking the medication and being able to function.  I am still limited in my physical activity, but I'm working and not constantly focused on the pain.","I take the Oxycontin three times a day - morning, lunch and dinner.

(If I didn't catch it at the onset, the capsule generally had no effect).  I would then lie down in a quiet, dark room.  The pill would typically reduce the headache within 30-45 minutes.  Occasionally I would end up feeling sluggish afterwards - not sure if this was a result of the medication or the headache.  Regardless, it has worked well to reduce headache pain."

I was worrying that it would occur again at night while alone or sleeping.,I noticed that after taking the drug for several days I became very irritable and short tempered.

I noticed an increase in low back pain that I had in the sacral area associated with endometriosis and all over body aches associated with fibromyalgia.

I read that Nortriptyline at that time was being experimentally used for neurological pain so I asked to go back on to see if it helped and it did.
ALthough I eventually had to have a hysterectomy due to the severity of the endometriosis I still had/have to deal with chronic pain of fibromyalgia.  I cannot tolerate the pain without the Nortriptyline 50mg at bedtime.

I would highly recommend a trial of this if you have any chronic pain issues at all.  Although other pain meds may have to be taken occasionally due to severity changes the Nortriptyline for me really cuts that down."

Then I started to have choking fits. They were becoming so serious that I feared choking to death. I suspected Advair, so I tried not taking it and then taking it again. The cause was identified and I stopped taking Advair. The choking fits ceased. The fatigue, anxiety, and panic attacks were found to be a malfunciton of my adrenal gland (confimed by lab tests). The chronic bronchitis improved dramatically.","I was diagnosed with COPD about 12 years ago. I started taking Advair about eight years ago. During the course of treatment I tried Spiriva, but had to stop because it was very drying. At one time I was taking Singulair, but that didn't seem to do much of anything. So I quit that.

Onset was rapid and anxiety producing. The extended release did  not work for me. I was tried on a variety of doses, from several small doses through out the day, with minimal effectiveness, to several higher doses per day, up to 20mg 3x a day in combination with Xanax to decrease the anxiety. I was not prescribed Xanax prior to the higher doses of Ritalin. That combination worked better than the previous, but I felt drugged out a lot. So my doctor put me on 20 mg at 6am, and noon, with a small 5-10mg dose in the evening, and Xanax only as needed. I learned to live with the anxiety and work around it. I planned my doses where the onset(1 hour) would occur when I was alone or in only with a small group of people. I had to plan everything around the Ritalin to survive with the anxiety, but it was very difficult. But it was the only way I could keep a job. Without the Ritalin I was unable to concentrate enough at work to remain employed. 

Eventually my doctor retired, and I went to a psychiatrist who has ADHD himself, and he prescribes Adderall, 20mg early morning and noon, and 10 mg mid  afternoon.

My previous thyroid doctor gave me an iodine uptake scan, took my bloodwork and diagnosed me with Hashimotos disease. Thyroid doctor said the best thing was to let my thyroid burn itself out and then he would put me on thyroid medicine, something I now feel was a mistake and should not have been done. Per my initial thyroid doctor, Hashimotos is sometimes hard to stabilize, thus, the Unithroid drug dosage I initially received .75 mcg had to be re-adjusted several times during the first year in order to stabilize my thyroid levels. Dosage was increased to 100 mcg. then to 125 mcg. then increased to 150 mcg. At some point, during these adjustments I went to another thyroid doctor who prescribed the T3 drug called Cytomel which gave me violent heart palpitations and I was taken off of this drug. The last Unithroid prescription dosage re-adustment I was given was for 150 mcg. 1xday 6 days wk with 1/2 dosage to be taken on Sundays. Medication to be taken on an empty stomach every morning. Last year, my body became Toxic to the Unithroid as I hadn't been to see the doctor in a while and had to be taken off the medication entirely for several days. Was restarted at a low dose of 50 mcg. because the toxicity had caused my pulse to race abnormally interupting my daily activities. This dosage was gradually increased I am now being treated with a Unithroid dosage of 125 mcg. For whatever reason, this survey is being taken, it would be a blessing to myself and so many others if for once someone would develop a natural alternative to drugs like Unithroid, Synthroid etc. other than the natural alternatives on the market that are derived from Pigs glands considering more people than not today do not intake pork products of any kind."

I have always had severe asthma and allergies and was hospitalized many times as a youngster.  I did have allergy shots which I truly think helped with my allergies.  When I got older, and inhaled cortisteroids were invented I started taking them, along with Singulair.  I was told that it was the ""most benign medication that I was on"" so I never thought twice about popping that small pill each day.  I suffered from frequent chest infections - that is a side effect of the singulair since it blocks the leuketrines that react and cause inflammation.  When I was 25, I started having severe mood swings and had to start taking an anti-depressant.  I continued the singulair without any thoughts.  However, after my third child, we were broke and I was trying to cut some medications down to save money and I stopped the singulair for a while.  I did notice that my asthma got worse so I figured oh well, have to start the Singulair again, that's when I started having the severe mood swings again.  I started doing some research online and read an article written by a mother who lost her son to suicide and attributed it to the singulair.  In my heart of hearts, I truly believe that more attention should be given to this drug, and it's affects on the brain.  I am no longer taking it and I am having much better luck with zyrtec."

Two brain chemicals in particular�dopamine and norepinephrine�are believed to play an important role in the ability to focus and pay attention to tasks.","Sometimes, I find I'm a little more tired when I miss a day.","I was diagnosed with Attention Deficient Disorder 13 years ago, a year after it was discovered that my daughter, then six, had the disorder.

My mind stops trying to jump from one subject to another every second; memory retention/recall improves DRAMATICALLY. I also find it FAR easier to fall asleep at night, seem to sleep better, and seem to be far more emotionally stable. I also do not ""crash"" from it later in the day like my former (stimulant) meds. Also does not appear to be physically addictive.","Severe grogginess, often accompanied by lightheadedness, upset stomach/nausea - ALL aggravated by sleep loss or lack of food, become slightly less severe after I'd been on it again for a couple of weeks. Severe grogginess was slightly alleviated by caffeine (espresso) or some rest (nap) or both. Best solution appears to be to take the meds with or after food, and to attempt to get a decent amount of sleep. Also notice a certain level of dependence (NOT actual addiction though) - mostly due to return of symptoms in medication's absence. I may also have dry mouth, but I'm not sure if that's the meds or if I'm not drinking enough water.","Best way I've discovered to eliminate the side effects is to eat a protein-rich breakfast (usually egg/ham/cheese sandwich for me), then WAIT for at least a few minutes -anywhere from 15 to 60 or more- before taking the medication. Seems to retain efficacy, COMPLETELY eliminate stomach problems and GREATLY reduce grogginess -though that also seems to be partly dependent on how much sleep I get (minimum of 6 hours, preferably 8 or 9). Now that I discovered this trick, I am feeling MUCH better and no longer considering abandoning the medication! I like that it helps with sleeping quality on top of helping me focus, remember, and feel more aware of surroundings. Would cry now if I had to go back to not using it - I almost can't function without medication, and the non-stimulant allows me to sleep SO much better and I do not ""crash"" from it!"

Our son was given Prevacid after being diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis in an attempt to stop frequent bouts of mid-night stomach pain.

I had actually reacted fairly badly to other, similar drugs. The famous ""purple pill"" Nexium had actually given me a brutal headache, sore-throat, and even a racing heart-beat at times.

2176,zyrtec,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,atopic eczema,"The drug was very effective in counteracting severe itching caused by atopic eczema. Zyrtec was more effective than other similar drugs (Zodac, Zaditen) which I took before for the same condition.

A VERY HIGH dose (only taken accidentally, because I forgot I had taken my usual dose earlier) on an empty stomach, will produce an unpleasant ""high"" feeling mentally, including spaciness and shakiness.  Therefore you can't just keep taking more and more of the drug.","Bottom line, this drug just isn't very effective.  It's more effective, and SIGNIFICANTLY SAFER, than the NSAIDS that docs are still prescribing for fibromylagia.  But I am looking for better daily pain management."

I called the manufacture (Bayer), they took down the lot number and said we are sorry.  They said they were going to send a new box to my local pharmacy at no charge.  I have checked every week for the last three weeks and NOTHING!  Yeah, great way to follow through.  Throughout being on the patch I noticed large acne on my face, lack of energy, no libido, vaginal dryness, daily hot flashes and extreme moodiness (so sorry to my husband, even though he has been great through all of this).
